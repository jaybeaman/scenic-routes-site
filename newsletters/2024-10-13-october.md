*Take 2, October 13th, 2024*

Hi Neighbors,

Happy October! A few weeks ago while Jay, Jerry and I were all sat atop silver Lyft bikes making our way through the wiggle on our way to dinner Jay leaned over and said "Man Ayla, could you have imagined a year ago that you'd be riding through the city on a balmy October evening with two middle aged men AND be having the time of your life?!" While my response in the moment was to have a giggle about how absurd we must have looked as a group, no is the answer, and having two middle aged besties with graying hair definitely wasn't on my bingo card for the year, or even the decade. But for the rest of the evening I couldn't help but smile at the thought of my beautiful friendships with the people who help make Scenic Routes what it is.

Just a couple weeks later, Jay's question continued to circulate through my mind as five of us (plus Atlas!!) all made our way over the Golden Gate Bridge, onto the Bay Area Ridge Trail, through Fairfax, and up into the Redwoods at Samuel P. Taylor for a night of camping next to the creek. My life was changed the day I walked through those glass doors on Balboa street, but I never could have imagined to what degree I myself would be changed, and this trip was a stark reminder of what a year can do. You see, the thing about riding 30 miles in 98 degree weather is that your mind has a lot of time to spin, and for 28 of those 30 miles my mind was filled with feelings of deep gratitude for the bicycle, for community, and for ice cold water (the other two miles were filled with regret and the taste of sweat in my mouth). Our trip was hard and hot, but it gave me an opportunity to once again view Scenic Routes as an outsider. While inside the four walls of the bike shop, I sometimes lose focus of what our true goal is. Because yes, we are trying to repair bikes and sell patch kits and keep the doors open, but really, we are trying to cultivate a community that is centered around bicycle joy.

You realize that having the ability to do mechanical repairs on bikes is a *gift* while being confronted with the absolute joy that comes along with spending three days on your saddle, pushing your body to the brink of its limits. In fact, four minutes after crossing the bridge, I ran into a situation with my front derailleur, and what could have been a trip-ruiner turned into a 10 minute break while Jay retrieved his multitool and set me right for the remainder of the ride. (Thank you Jay!!!) The feeling of self sufficiency, or perhaps - community sufficiency, that comes with being able to fix an issue on the side of the road and continue on your planned route is a rush like no other. Every time I've shifted since that repair I have been reminded of the time and effort that Jay has put into expanding his mechanical expertise, and I see a future version of myself that is confident and sure not only of my right to be in the world of bicycles, but also my right to be a mechanic in the world of bicycles.

This desire to find self sufficiency in a world that is catered to men and those who call themselves "athletes" is why I am so excited about our free monthly classes.

Let's stop the chit chat and get into the nitty gritty of it, shall we:

**FIRST THURSDAY:**

*Flat Fix Class - 7:15-9:00pm*

We will hold your hand through removing your tire, patching your tube, troubleshooting repairs, and getting your wheels back into a rideable state. You'll leave feeling confident enough to rip through even the most debris-covered downtown streets, and ride into the most secluded back wood trails. Bring your questions and tell a friend, and join us from 7:15pm to 9:00 on Thursday November 7th, December 5th, or January 2nd.

All supplies included, but feel free to bring your own flat tires that need repairing. Spots are limited, so you'll have all the attention you need, but you'll want to sign up soon! Wear clothes you don't mind getting dirty, and be prepared to use your hands. Class is free, but please sign up on our website!

**SECOND THURSDAY:**

*Night Moves - Meet at 7:15, Roll at 7:30*

Join us for a beginner friendly, good vibes focused ride the second Thursday of every month. The route will be chosen based on the group, and while fitness level is deeply personal, our goal is that every person who wants to come can come. No drops, lots of resting, and a pit stop somewhere beautiful for tea and cookies. Bring yourself, bring your dog, bring a friend, and BRING A MUG!!!

**THIRD THURSDAY:**

*Beginner Mechanics Class - Tubeless Edition - 7:15-9:00*

Join us as we demystify the tubeless tire set up and teach you how to fix flats, add sealant, and understand the anatomy of a tubeless tire. We'll be punching holes and getting our hands dirty, so come prepared to get in on the action. You're welcome to bring your own bike if you want to practice on your own wheels, but all you need is a good attitude and the desire to learn! Class is free, but please sign up on our website!

**LAST SUNDAY:**

*Day Grooves - Meet at 11:00, Roll at 11:30*

Join me (Ayla) on October 27th for our first monthly ride targeted towards **women and queer people** (and anyone who feels they may fit somewhere in that realm). Everyone is welcome, but please be mindful of the space that you're taking up as an ally if you aren't a member of the queer community or a woman!!!!!! We will cruise up Lake Street towards the Legion of Honor, down towards Ocean Beach, and will end at the Great Walkway so that those of you who plan to attend the Great Hauntway event can pop over. Costumes are encouraged. Come celebrate the season with me!!!! Put on a silly hat, paint your face green, pop a pumpkin in your basket, whatever! See you there!!

REMINDER: October's community night is **CANCELED**. We want to go hang out with our favorite three year old, sorry pals.

**THINGS MEN SAID TO ME ON MY BIKE**

(from least worst to worst)

3. "WOMEN ARE POWERFUL" after being advised to use hydrogen peroxide as a means of removing blood. 10/10, women ARE powerful.

2. MWAH (with a wink at me out his car window), Emily (my girlfriend) dings her bell, man says "Hey you fucking BITCH." 0/10, you're laughable my guy!!!

1. Man riding down the path with an Israel flag attached to his bike "Hey sexy mama" -2/10, so icky, so gross, so unwelcome. YUCK!
