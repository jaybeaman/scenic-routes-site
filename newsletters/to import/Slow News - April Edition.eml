%3A05Z> Take 8, April 10th Slow News. Hi Neighbors, I promised Ayla I=E2=80=
=99d write the newsletter this week and it=E2=80=99s been like pulling teet=
h in fits and starts two steps forward and one back and any other cliche yo=
u can think of because, you see, I feel like writing things down makes them=
 permanent. Like you REALLY mean them. I=E2=80=99ve always been a =E2=80=9C=
feel them strongly but hold them loosely=E2=80=9D kind of opinion holder an=
d there are just so many men on the internet with strong opinions (about bi=
kes and otherwise) who hold them so tightly and it=E2=80=99s exhausting. I =
much prefer to talk - it=E2=80=99s the 25 years of bartending in me - come =
by the shop and I=E2=80=99ll tell you what I think about the New Yorker=E2=
=80=99s best book list or how to socialize a feral kitten or how bike sizin=
g works or AI or the epidemic of isolation and loneliness. I have musings, =
strong and otherwise, about all kinds of things. I try to keep my really st=
rong opinions to things in which I am an expert and I try to keep ALL my op=
inions held lightly. I=E2=80=99m ready for new information and I=E2=80=99m =
ready to adapt. So, coming here and hyping myself up to tell you what I thi=
nk about our world (big world - Palestine, the failure of the Democratic pa=
rty, the epidemic of isolation and loneliness and small world - the city=E2=
=80=99s failure to fund MUNI, the foolish attempt to recall Joel Engardio, =
the epidemic of isolation and loneliness), fills me with misgivings. But I =
do have something to say, and I promised Ayla, so here we are. We need to s=
top giving our money to monsters. I know there=E2=80=99s no ethical consump=
tion under capitalism but going to the Hands Off protest and then taking an=
 Uber home and ordering Doordash is a choice. Almost every day someone brin=
gs in a part they bought on Amazon and asks us to install it and that is a =
choice. I believe it=E2=80=99s a moral choice and it has consequences. And =
I'm not even talking about funneling all the money into a few billionaires =
who are funding autocracy, though that's happening too, I=E2=80=99m talking=
 about something even more important. And I=E2=80=99m no purist, man. I nee=
ded a stupid, proprietary thing for the shop the other day and it was $50 e=
verywhere except for Amazon and fucking Walmart where it was $25 - I=E2=80=
=99m not a fool, I bought it from Walmart and it=E2=80=99s bugged me ever s=
ince. Free shipping! At what cost? The cost is the degradation of our most =
beloved and cherished spaces - our cities. If you buy your toilet paper fro=
m Jeff Bezos then local markets can't sustain themselves (or become prohibi=
tively expensive) and struggle paying their staff a living wage. Workers ar=
e forced to live farther and farther from work, commuting hours each way. T=
he local cafe can't stay open because there's not enough foot traffic. The =
bookstore that hosted community events closes. The hardware store where the=
 owner knew exactly what obscure screw you needed disappears. There is an e=
pidemic of isolation and loneliness. I think I might have mentioned that be=
fore. This isn't just about convenience versus inconvenience. It's about th=
e slow death of community spaces. When we click BUY NOW we're not just purc=
hasing a product, we're voting for a future where our neighborhoods are hol=
lowed out. Every delivery van that rumbles down your street represents anot=
her nail in the coffin of vibrant urban life. Our cities evolved over centu=
ries as spaces for connection (and commerce). The corner store wasn't just =
where you bought milk - it was where you bumped into neighbors, where the c=
ashier asked about your kids, where community notices hung in the window. W=
hen we replace these interactions with the sterile ping of a delivery notif=
ication, we lose something profound. Look around your neighborhood. Notice =
the empty storefronts, the "for lease" signs that stay up for years. That's=
 the physical manifestation of our collective online shopping habits. We're=
 trading the soul of our cities for the convenience of two-day shipping and=
 it's a shit bargain. The bottom line is if you buy tires from the internet=
 website amazon dot com I can=E2=80=99t pay Ayla=E2=80=99s salary or afford=
 the electric bill or buy satsuma mandarins for the staff and, ultimately, =
we won=E2=80=99t be here to help you install them. Do I sound dramatic? I d=
o not mean to sound dramatic, and we won=E2=80=99t be shutting down shop if=
 we can=E2=80=99t afford mandarins, but our world will be a little more dul=
l without our choice of spring produce. And in the swirling shitstorm of a =
doom scrolling world a small thing you can do to make your corner of this d=
ying planet a bit better is to stop by your local market and ask how everyo=
ne=E2=80=99s doing. It=E2=80=99s weird to say but=E2=80=A6buy stuff. An old=
 Austin bartender once told me =E2=80=9Cit seems like this whole economy is=
 propped up by us going around and stuffing money in each other=E2=80=99s t=
ip jars=E2=80=9D and that seems like a good economy to me. Let=E2=80=99s pa=
y each other, prop each other up and in the places that allow and encourage=
 it - hang out a bit, loiter, browse, poke about. We want you here bugging =
us! It=E2=80=99s our whole reason for being and we=E2=80=99re grateful for =
your patronage. Jay Okay. Ayla here, but just for a minute. I handed the ke=
yboard over to Jay this month because puppy raising is somehow a bigger dis=
traction than grad school and between the two of them I can=E2=80=99t keep =
anything straight. But I still wanted to let you know that our events are g=
oing strong and keep you all in the loop. Each month we have a better idea =
of how to give you guys a good time, how to teach you things you want to kn=
ow, and how much hot water we need to bring for tea. This month on the cale=
ndar: Night Moves! - Thursday, April 10th (thats today) Meet at 521 Balboa =

3A36%3A05Z> Community Night! - Thursday, April 24th @ 7:00 - 9:00 Come shar=
e space with us in the shop, have a drink, a laugh, pet a puppy, ask your b=
ike questions (or life questions) and listen to the music play a little lou=

y, April 27th Meet at 521 Balboa Street at 10:45, Roll at 11:00 Guys, I got=
 the memo, the girls and the gays do NOT want to wake up at 9:00 in the mor=
ning to go ride with me!! How silly of me! Back to an 11:00 start. I=E2=80=
=99m thinking we make our way to a coffee shop for some silly little cappuc=
inos and a little bit of gossip. How fun! SEE YOU THERE. And really, the be=
st Scenic Routes event is happening from noon to seven, Wednesday through S=
unday every single week. When our doors are open, we are here for you to po=
p by, yap for a minute or twenty, and then go back about your business. Are=
 you on Balboa getting lunch at Cinderella? Bring us a cookie and tell us a=
bout your day! Are you on Clement picking up books at Green Apple? Swing by=
 and give us a review of the novel you just finished. Are you on the other =
side of the bridge having a mechanical issue that you just can=E2=80=99t fi=
gure out? Send us a text and we=E2=80=99ll walk you through whatever drama =
has come your way. The point being, our events are a time for us to get tog=
ether and let our circles mix, but the time for community is ALWAYS. And mo=
re specifically, noon to seven, Wednesday through Sunday :) Ayla Visit our =
