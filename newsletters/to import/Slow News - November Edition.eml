A21%3A39Z> Take 14, November 1st, 2025 Slow News. Hey Neighbors, Jay here. =
If you=E2=80=99ve spent any time at Scenic Routes the last few years, you w=
ill have surely caught the drifting smells of madras curry (or potato leek =
soup or Tuscan stewed beans) intermingled with the sounds of Chopin (or Car=
ly Rae Jepsen or Gang of Four). Music and food. There is no one in my life =
that has taught me more about music and food (and leadership and responsibi=
lity and kindness, but I won=E2=80=99t pepper this newsletter with endless =
parentheticals) than Brad Levy, the longtime owner (now co-owner with the i=
nimitable Haley Sausner who has also taught me much but let=E2=80=99s stay =
focused) of Firefly Restaurant. I started at Firefly as a clumsy, oafish bu=
sser in 2004. The staff snickered =E2=80=9Cwhat about Jay?=E2=80=9D when Br=
ad gave a speech about =E2=80=9Cmoving with grace on the floor.=E2=80=9D My=
 staunchest defender and co-busser Franz shot back =E2=80=9Cit=E2=80=99s a =
savage grace.=E2=80=9D Savage, true, but my eyes were forced wide open as I=
 pretended I knew what Osso Buco was and fumbled the pronunciation of Haric=
ot Verts (why don=E2=80=99t you just call it green beans you fucking snobs?=
) and read and listened and learned. During staff tastings, Brad would rout=
inely run his finger along a plate and suck the sauce cleanly off. I can wo=
rk for this guy, I thought. He both taught me about proven=C3=A7al soupe au=
 pistou and the finer points of bitter greens and why duck fat made chicken=
 livers so creamy and would talk about Texas bbq and the best baked beans. =
He was a snob but also a man of the people. He told us that to feed people =
was the greatest gift we could give them=E2=80=94that to nourish was an act=
 of love. The first meal ever given to you was literally a gift created fro=
m your mother=E2=80=99s body. I had never heard anything like this and was =
floored. You see, food was a weapon in my house growing up =E2=80=94 a tool=
 to manipulate and control =E2=80=94 an object of shame or, even worse, ind=
ifference. Brad taught me food was an act of joy and kindness and skill and=
 art and it was fucking wild. That was more than 20 years ago, and in the l=
ast 20 years I=E2=80=99ve become a pretty good cook, much of that stewarded=
 by Brad=E2=80=99s (and later Haley=E2=80=99s) mostly kind, but occasionall=
y barbed instruction. It=E2=80=99s now ingrained in me that to feed is to l=
ove =E2=80=94 that listening to your loved ones and feeding them what they =
want is a gift. Ayla has celiac and Joel is pescatarian who thinks dairy is=
 gross and Lily has tummy issues and Jerry is a committed and thoughtful ve=
gan and the array of kind volunteers include those who are vegan but will e=
at cheese occasionally and those who hate fish but are ok with sushi and th=
ose who don=E2=80=99t like food that is orange. Brad taught me that food sh=
ould never be poison, and we should feed people what nourishes them as an a=
ct of love. As our staff grew, Ayla and I talked it over and we decided eve=
ryone gets fed at Scenic Routes. There will always be snacks, there will al=
ways be lunch. You will love what we feed you or we will adapt. You want in=
? You want to be fed or to feed us? Shoot us a text and we=E2=80=99ll put y=
ou in the rotation. Sidenote =E2=80=93 I started writing this a few weeks a=
go, before we knew that the ongoing government shutdown would result in del=
ayed SNAP benefits and directly contribute to growing food insecurity for m=
illions of people across the country (including hundreds of thousands of pe=
ople in the Bay Area). All of it is even more true now. I can guarantee you=
 that if you want or need to be fed, there will be food here at Scenic Rout=
es, between 2 and 4 (or 4:30 if Ayla=E2=80=99s cooking). This month =E2=80=
=93 the month that typically involves food and gathering and nourishing eac=
h other =E2=80=93 we=E2=80=99re also going to bring that approach into our =
rides. This month=E2=80=99s Night Moves will be all about soup. We=E2=80=99=
ll take our usual all-abilities-welcome ride, ending at Mountain Lake Park,=
 and our soup stewards will join us there with all kinds of soup and severa=
l kinds of bread. Bring a bowl, a cup, a spoon, your bike, and anything els=
e you need to enjoy a great view and some soup with your community! Novembe=
r 13th. Meet at 7:15, roll at 7:30. I am an enthusiast generally and relish=
 in enthusiasms, be it bikes or food or building computers or mapping route=
s. Ten or twelve years ago I asked Brad to suggest some great piano music t=
hat was =E2=80=9Cnot too interruptive" =E2=80=94 an insufferable and bonehe=
aded question as the greatest piano music demands the listeners attention. =
Brad surely knew this but graciously suggested Erik Satie. Faint praise =E2=
=80=94 even though Satie is a genius, the man=E2=80=99s music can be ignore=
d =E2=80=94 but I listened and loved it. And then came Bach =E2=80=94 the G=
oldbergs were a mystery to me =E2=80=94 how and why did Glenn Gould record =
it and then record it again 25 years later? The two recordings sounded basi=
cally the same to my naive ears. Brad, always the thoughtful steward and te=
acher, suggested I listen and listen and listen until I got it. So, as inst=
ructed, I listened. I listened to the 1955 version every day for a month an=
d then listened to the 1981 version every day for another month and I heard=
 it! What did I hear? No surprise: one had the lively and ebullient ferocit=
y of youth and the other had the thoughtful, careful, loving pace of middle=
 age. Then came Schumann and Schubert and Beethoven and Chopin. It all fold=
ed into my music brain alongside my love of =E2=80=9890s and 2000s indie ro=
ck and punk and moody folk and outlaw country. A gift I could never imagine=
 being given. The first (or second =E2=80=94 coffee is powerful) thing I do=
 when I walk in the door at Scenic Routes is play some music. And we often,=
 as Brad suggested, listen to things over and over and over. This year we p=
robably listened to Cameron Winter=E2=80=99s solo record 100 times =E2=80=
=94 Lily, ever armed with a sassy, brilliant witticism, quipped =E2=80=9Cth=
e first 20 times I was all =E2=80=98GAHD. Who is this sad sack whiner=E2=80=
=99 and then one day =E2=80=98IT=E2=80=99S THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING I=E2=80=
=99VE EVER HEARD.=E2=80=9D Natalie is now a dedicated James McMurtry fan. A=
yla is thrilled by Irish country lunatic CMAT. Joel has taught us more abou=
t post-punk than we ever thought we wanted to know. We all love Grieg=E2=80=
=99s Lyric Pieces (thank you, again, Brad). But Bach will forever hold a pl=
ace in my heart. So for January=E2=80=99s Night Moves, Scenic Routes is tak=
ing you to the beach with Bach. Or, for the pun-lovers, the name of the rid=
e is =E2=80=9CTo The Beach and Bach=E2=80=9D. Or =E2=80=9CRolling Fugue=E2=
=80=9D. Bring an old AM/FM battery-powered radio (if you don=E2=80=99t know=
 what that is or where to find one, ask your dad), and come listen to Bach =
with us as we ride to the beach. January 8th. Meet at 7:15, roll at 7:30. S=
o, if you=E2=80=99ve wandered into Scenic Routes at any time over the last =
few years and asked us what music we=E2=80=99ve got playing, or asked us wh=
at=E2=80=99s for lunch, we really love that you asked! And we=E2=80=99re re=
ally glad that you=E2=80=99re here. We=E2=80=99ll see you soon, Jay Other d=
ates to know: The first Sunday of every month we are hosting the Quercus Fa=
mily Bike Ride. Which is tomorrow! See you at 9:00am in front of the Conser=
vatory of Flowers. We=E2=80=99ll be gone fishin=E2=80=99 (or in this case, =
camping) the weekend after Thanksgiving. The shop will be open on November =
26, closed from November 27 through November 30, and open again on December=
 2nd. There will be no Night Moves in December: we=E2=80=99re having a holi=
day party instead! Join us at the shop on December 11th for some music, com=
pany, and some of Mary=E2=80=99s punch. Starts at 7pm, goes =E2=80=98til wh=
enever. We=E2=80=99re open on Christmas Eve (December 24th), but closed fro=
m December 25th through 28th. Open on December 30th and 31st, closed Januar=
y 1st for inventory, and then back to our regular schedule on January 2! To=

relish in enthusiasms, be it bikes or food or building computers or mapping=
 routes. Ten or twelve years ago I asked Brad to suggest some great piano m=
usic that was =E2=80=9Cnot too interruptive" =E2=80=94 an insufferable and =
boneheaded question as the greatest piano music demands the listeners atten=
tion. Brad surely knew this but graciously suggested Erik Satie. Faint prai=
se =E2=80=94 even though Satie is a genius, the man=E2=80=99s music can be =
ignored =E2=80=94 but I listened and loved it.</p><p class=3D"" style=3D"co=

 then came Bach =E2=80=94 the Goldbergs were a mystery to me =E2=80=94 how =
and why did Glenn Gould record it and then record it again 25 years later? =
The two recordings sounded basically the same to my naive ears. Brad, alway=
s the thoughtful steward and teacher, suggested I listen and listen and lis=
ten until I got it. So, as instructed, I listened. I listened to the 1955 v=
ersion every day for a month and then listened to the 1981 version every da=
y for another month and I heard it! What did I hear? No surprise: one had t=
he lively and ebullient ferocity of youth and the other had the thoughtful,=
 careful, loving pace of middle age. Then came Schumann and Schubert and Be=
ethoven and Chopin. It all folded into my music brain alongside my love of =
=E2=80=9890s and 2000s indie rock and punk and moody folk and outlaw countr=
y. A gift I could never imagine being given.&nbsp;</p><p class=3D"" style=

 I do when I walk in the door at Scenic Routes is play some music. And we o=
