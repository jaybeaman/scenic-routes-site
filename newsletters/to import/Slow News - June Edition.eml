%3A41Z> Take 10, June 1st 2025 Slow News. Hi Neighbors, Happy June! Summer =
has arrived and the fog has rolled in to remind us that nothing is as simpl=
e as it seems. Life is undeniably full of changes, and most often, the chan=
ges come to us in the form of shocking surprises and unexpected challenges.=
 Currently, the biggest change in my life is that for the first time since =
I was four years old, I=E2=80=99m not in school. There are no more classes =
to sign up for, requirements to check off a list, or lectures to attend. My=
 degree is in the mail and as of now I have no plans for any higher educati=
on. And while yes, I learned invaluable lessons during my Master=E2=80=99s =
program, I can not wait to sink my teeth into the school of Scenic Routes. =
Last summer I was supposed to attend the professional mechanic=E2=80=99s co=
urse at the United Bicycle Institute in Ashland Oregon. Instead, I broke my=
 wrist and spent the summer disobeying doctor=E2=80=99s orders and riding m=
y bike around with my arm in a hot pink cast. I was so devastated to miss m=
y opportunity to go learn how to be a bike mechanic in a professional setti=
ng. My whole life revolved around my college education and I thought that l=
earning in a classroom setting was the only way to prepare myself for the j=
ob ahead. I thought my little crash had set me back from becoming a real me=
chanic. Mind you, at this point I=E2=80=99d already been working at the sho=
p for nearly a year. I could do all the basic maintenance you can think of,=
 install headsets and bottom brackets, bleed hydraulic brakes, handbuild wh=
eels, and service parts I didn=E2=80=99t even know existed before I walked =
through the doors of the shop. Yes I still had a lot to learn, and the cour=
se at UBI definitely would have been more than informative, but what I was =
lacking was not skill, but confidence. A year later, part of me would trade=
 my entire Master=E2=80=99s degree for that piece of paper from UBI telling=
 me I=E2=80=99m a certified mechanic, but my real classroom was staring me =
straight in the face. Jay taught himself how to be a bike mechanic in his d=
ining room at the beginning of the pandemic when people were desperate to g=
et on their bikes. The skills he has to share with me are ones that he earn=
ed through trial and error and long hours reading manuals. Joel has been a =
mechanic for 30 years. The skills he has to share are ones that he earned t=
hrough a lifetime of dedication to the craft. =E2=80=9CThey aren=E2=80=99t =
gonna teach you that at UBI=E2=80=9D is Joel=E2=80=99s favorite line to say=
 with a smile on his face while performing miracles on bikes that haven=E2=
=80=99t run smoothly since before I was alive. Jay told me last week that I=
 was born to work on bikes. I told him that he was born to be a teacher. I=
=E2=80=99m grateful every day that Jay gave me an opportunity to be a begin=
ner in a field that doesn't offer many opportunities for those that fit int=
o my demographic (i.e. young, queer, woman). I=E2=80=99m passionate about t=
he work we do at Scenic Routes. I love helping our community find ways to r=
ide bikes that feel joyful and safe and fulfilling for them. I love leading=
 rides and managing our inventory and writing these emails, and more and mo=
re everyday, I love being a mechanic. At the end of the day, I love bikes. =
Working as a bike mechanic isn=E2=80=99t a path I ever saw myself going dow=
n, but because of my teachers and mentors, I can=E2=80=99t imagine myself d=
oing anything else. Some days I still feel like I=E2=80=99m just a little g=
irl when I=E2=80=99m behind the counter at the shop (and I will use it as a=
n excuse to get out of the heavy lifting) but more often than not, I can fe=
el the confidence I was so desperately seeking from a UBI certificate comin=
g from a place of true competence. Bring your bike to Scenic Routes and I w=
ill help you fix it. Come to our classes and I will teach you what I know. =
The pursuit of education doesn't need to happen in a classroom, instead, it=
 can happen within our own communities. And speaking of which, here are our=
 community events for the month: SCENIC ROUTES CAMP OUT! Sunday, June 15th =
to Monday June 16th Join us for a beginner bike packing trip to Rob Hill Ca=
mpground in the Presidio. No experience required and no gear required, we h=
ave all the things you need to borrow! There will be two separate groups: S=
traight to Camp - Don=E2=80=99t want to ride far with all your gear? Choose=
 this option if you want to focus more on the camping part and less on the =
riding part. Meet at 3:30, roll at 4:00. Hard Mode - We=E2=80=99ll take the=
 long way to Rob Hill from the shop. This is for those of you who want to p=
ractice riding with a loaded bike, who want to extend the adventure. Meet a=

nd us that nothing is as simple as it seems. Life is undeniably full of cha=
nges, and most often, the changes come to us in the form of shocking surpri=
ses and unexpected challenges. Currently, the biggest change in my life is =
that for the first time since I was four years old, I=E2=80=99m not in scho=
ol. There are no more classes to sign up for, requirements to check off a l=
ist, or lectures to attend. My degree is in the mail and as of now I have n=
o plans for any higher education. And while yes, I learned invaluable lesso=
ns during my Master=E2=80=99s program, I can not wait to sink my teeth into=
 the school of Scenic Routes.&nbsp;</p><p style=3D"color:inherit;font-size:=

tead, I broke my wrist and spent the summer disobeying doctor=E2=80=99s ord=
ers and riding my bike around with my arm in a hot pink cast. I was so deva=
stated to miss my opportunity to go learn how to be a bike mechanic in a pr=
ofessional setting. My whole life revolved around my college education and =
I thought that learning in a classroom setting was the only way to prepare =
myself for the job ahead. I thought my little crash had set me back from be=
coming a real mechanic.&nbsp;</p><p style=3D"color:inherit;font-size:.9375e=

d through the doors of the shop. Yes I still had a lot to learn, and the co=
urse at UBI definitely would have been more than informative, but what I wa=
s lacking was not skill, but confidence. A year later, part of me would tra=
de my entire Master=E2=80=99s degree for that piece of paper from UBI telli=
