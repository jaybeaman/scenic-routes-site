t_date=3D2025-07-05T21%3A02%3A12Z> Take 10, June 5th 2025 Slow News. Hey Ne=
ighbors! May I introduce to you the =E2=80=9CScenic Routes Center for Bicyc=
le Culture.=E2=80=9D Wait, what? Isn=E2=80=99t this Scenic Routes Community=
 Bicycle Center? Well yes, it is, and it always will be, but it is also now=
 the Center for Bicycle Culture. And in six months it might be something el=
se. We like to keep our options open and hold our truths lightly over here.=
 You never know what you=E2=80=99re going to get when you walk in the doors=
 of 521 Balboa, but we will always give you our authenticity, attention, an=
d time. Our new little name means nothing except some additions to our stic=
ker and merch collection, but it does beg the question, what is bicycle cul=
ture? What is the bicycle culture that we want to promote when people walk =
through the doors of our shop, when people look at our instagram, or read o=
ur newsletter? What we really want is for people to feel safe. Safe to ask =
their questions, safe to be new at something, safe from the casual violence=
 of motor vehicles, and safe to participate in an activity that requires us=
 to move our bodies in ways that sometimes feel uncomfortable. We want the =
culture of bicycles to be one that is radically opposed to the extractive, =
capitalist, often soul crushing world that we live in. Our bikes are our mo=
des of transportation, our means of exercise, and beautiful pieces of art w=
ork, but they are also a symbol that says =E2=80=9CHey! I am daring to live=
 outside the status quo.=E2=80=9D Being a part of the bicycle culture that =
Scenic Routes hopes to promote doesn=E2=80=99t even necessarily mean riding=
 a bike all that often. As someone who is chronically ill, there are months=
 that go by where the furthest my bike travels is from my house to the bike=
 shop. Seven whole blocks. But what a thrilling way to commute to work, fee=
l the wind in my hair, and move my body before sitting down to work on othe=
r people=E2=80=99s bikes for the day. The thrill isn=E2=80=99t about the sp=
eed or the distance or the difficulty, but the feeling of floating over the=
 city streets and watching the buildings blur together as you turn corner a=
fter corner. Our bicycle culture is about allowing yourself the opportunity=
 to connect to your physical body in a joyful way. Part of that joy is abou=
t reimagining what bikes can look like. If you=E2=80=99ve walked into the s=
hop recently, you might have noticed bright pink and yellow frames with pur=
ple tires and blue cable housing and little star shaped beads adorning them=
=2E One new customer thought we excl=
usively had children=E2=80=99s bikes. But=
 just because our bikes are shockingly cute, it doesn't mean they aren=E2=
=80=99t capable. They are well equipped to take you on all the rides your h=
eart desires, even if those desires change day to day. If some days your he=
art=E2=80=99s desires are to ride up Mount Tam and watch the fog roll over =
the hills and other days your heart=E2=80=99s desires are to cruise to the =
farmer=E2=80=99s market and fill your basket with stone fruit and fresh bak=
ed bread, our bikes are the ones for you, and our bicycle culture is the on=
e for you. Our bicycle culture is about reimagining the bounds of what bike=
s can be used for, along with what they can look like. The newest addition =
to my gaggle of bikes is a front bucket Larry v. Harry Bullit, bought just =
to cart my giant puppy around. Molly Haden flies around the city on her car=
go bike with people, plants, and pressure cargo every day of the week, and =
the countless cargo bike parents doing morning drop off via bike instead of=
 car are sweet reminders that cities are navigable without the constraints =
of a motor vehicle. In fact, not only is the city navigable, but it is a so=
urce of immense joy when you aren=E2=80=99t stuck behind red lights in a me=
tal box. Running your daily errands while pedaling your legs isn=E2=80=99t =
just a means of movement, it is a means of resistance. That is what our bic=
ycle culture is about. Our bicycle culture is about reimagining the bounds =
of what bikes can be used for, along with what they can look like. The newe=

ut it is a source of immense joy when you aren=E2=80=99t stuck behind red l=
ights in a metal box. Running your daily errands while pedaling your legs i=
sn=E2=80=99t just a means of movement, it is a means of resistance. That is=
 what our bicycle culture is about. There is a place for you within the wor=
ld of bicycles. This magical tool is not reserved for athletes and children=
=2E It is for everyone, in every season=
 of their lives. This month at Scenic=20=
Routes. Things are happening. Community is happening: Thursday, July 10th, =

rails in the park, and post up at the Fly Wheel Coffee Kiosk for some giggl=
ing and gossiping to end the day. Meet at 10:45, Roll at 11:00. P.S. Starti=
ng in August, Scenic Routes will have a new monthly ride geared towards fam=
ilies! We will meet outside the Conservatory of Flowers on JFK, cruise arou=
nd the car-free areas of the park, and end somewhere for a little picnic an=
d a story time! The ride will be the first Sunday of every month at 9:00am.=
 More details to come, but I=E2=80=99m really excited for this new addition=
 to our calendar! I hope you=E2=80=99re all finding pockets of sunshine in =

 when people look at our instagram, or read our newsletter? What we really =
want is for people to feel safe. Safe to ask their questions, safe to be ne=

o participate in an activity that requires us to move our bodies in ways th=
at sometimes feel uncomfortable. We want the culture of bicycles to be one =
that is radically opposed to the extractive, capitalist, often soul crushin=
g world that we live in. Our bikes are our modes of transportation, our mea=

re that Scenic Routes hopes to promote doesn=E2=80=99t even necessarily mea=
n riding a bike all that often. As someone who is chronically ill, there ar=
e months that go by where the furthest my bike travels is from my house to =
the bike shop. Seven whole blocks. But what a thrilling way to commute to w=
ork, feel the wind in my hair, and move my body before sitting down to work=
 on other people=E2=80=99s bikes for the day. The thrill isn=E2=80=99t abou=
t the speed or the distance or the difficulty, but the feeling of floating =
over the city streets and watching the buildings blur together as you turn =
corner after corner. Our bicycle culture is about allowing yourself the opp=
ortunity to connect to your physical body in a joyful way. Part of that joy=
 is about reimagining what bikes can look like. If you=E2=80=99ve walked in=
to the shop recently, you might have noticed bright pink and yellow frames =
with purple tires and blue cable housing and little star shaped beads adorn=
ing them. One new customer thought we exclusively had children=E2=80=99s bi=
kes. But just because our bikes are shockingly cute, it doesn't mean they a=
ren=E2=80=99t capable. They are well equipped to take you on all the rides =
your heart desires, even if those desires change day to day. If some days y=
our heart=E2=80=99s desires are to ride up Mount Tam and watch the fog roll=
 over the hills and other days your heart=E2=80=99s desires are to cruise t=
o the farmer=E2=80=99s market and fill your basket with stone fruit and fre=
sh baked bread, our bikes are the ones for you, and our bicycle culture is =
the one for you.&nbsp;</p><p style=3D"color:inherit;font-size:.9375em;margi=
