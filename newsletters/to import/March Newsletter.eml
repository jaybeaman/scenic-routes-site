ake 7, March 12, 2025 Slow News. Hi Neighbors, I have a hard time explainin=
g to people what my job is. I don=E2=80=99t really think of myself as a bik=
e mechanic (even though I am, at least one in training), I don=E2=80=99t re=
ally think of myself as a manager (even though I am, at least in theory), a=
nd I don=E2=80=99t really think of myself as anything else that would succi=
nctly sum up my job here at Scenic Routes in a way that makes sense to my O=
klahoma City relatives or my Grad School advisors. I usually land somewhere=
 around =E2=80=9Cwell I work at a bike shop=E2=80=A6=E2=80=9D which is gene=
rally met with polite smiles and nods, but not a single lick of understandi=
ng about what it is I do all day. This month I cut the zip ties holding my =
WALD 139 basket to my Pass and Stow three rail rack and replaced it with an=
 extra wide milk crate big enough to fit a rapidly growing puppy with more =
energy than I know how to contain. The furthest I=E2=80=99ve ridden my bike=
 since the arrival of Bennie is to Ocean Beach and back. Suddenly, a new jo=
b emerged in life. One full of sharp teeth, piss on the floor, and a shocki=
ng ability to blow through expensive toys. And although my wallet is a litt=
le lighter and my eyes are a little more tired, the work doesn=E2=80=99t fe=
el like work. In fact, it feels like a gift. There=E2=80=99s this thing tha=
t Jay sometimes says that he heard from Luke Spray (that I=E2=80=99m pretty=
 sure Luke read in a book) that goes a little something like this: =E2=80=
=9CWe often think we care for something because we love it, but more often =
than not, we love something because we have been given the opportunity to c=
are for it. When we picked Bennie up from the overcrowded shelter, I was gi=
ven the opportunity to hold her smelly, dirty body in my arms and share my =
warmth with her. I spoke to her quietly and fed her more treats than she ha=
d ever seen in her life. I rubbed her sweet puppy belly, adorned our house =
with dog beds in every corner and played music to lull her to sleep. She wa=
s a stranger, and I didn=E2=80=99t know her, but somehow, by just doing wha=
t I felt needed to be done for her, I loved her. Scenic Routes was a strang=
er when I walked in the doors. I didn=E2=80=99t understand the entity that =
was the community center, and frankly had no idea what running a small busi=
ness meant. I didn=E2=80=99t know how to fix a flat tire, open accounts, or=
 stock inventory. But I did know how to bake cookies, and so I did. Scenic =
Routes took care of me and my bike, and I wanted to take care of its people=
, so I vowed never to show up empty handed. I would come bearing mediocre g=
luten free goodies to share while Jay adjusted the rear derailleur (again) =
on my busted Marin. I would decorate entire cakes for no other celebration =
than the fact that the wheels on my bike were still spinning. Chocolate chi=
p, peanut butter, gingersnap! It was like I was trying to Pavlov them into =
working on my junk bike by showing up with sweets, but really, I was doing =
something for me. Soon, a delivery of cookies turned into showing up to wra=
p bars, and then fix flats, and then answer the phone and check people in. =
All of a sudden, I did know something, and what I knew was that I loved thi=
s bike shop. What was once an unknown place became my favorite place to be.=
 The people who once were strangers became my friends - my community. What =
I cared for became what I love. I think I must be the luckiest person in th=
e world, to have a job description that could read: Be someone that cares. =
When you walk into Scenic Routes, you will be taken care of. I will sit wit=
h you while you painstakingly decide which water bottle cage matches the vi=
be of your bike, I will get on the floor with you next to the bike corral a=
nd ask if that rack install is going well, I will listen to you tell me the=
 tale of your bikepacking trip and wipe the dirt that accumulated off your =
frame. I will cheer you on when you ride down the sidewalk outside the shop=
 (your first time on a bike in years!) and give you my opinion on helmet fi=
t. I=E2=80=99ll take you on bike rides and send you emails and debate for w=
ay too long about the perfect song for our instagram posts. I will care. Al=
as, having a community space that is functionally a business poses challeng=
es in our society built on extractive capitalism. There is always more room=
 for caring, but we are constantly fighting the battle of giving away every=
thing we own and keeping the doors open. We=E2=80=99d like to think, though=
, that in addition to being absolute pushovers in the caring department, we=
 are relatively smart people with good ideas about how we can expand our re=
ach. Our newest bid for community support goes a little something like this=
: Every couple of days a new, timid bright-eyed cyclist comes into shop ask=
ing if we sell used bikes and inevitably leave because they can't spend $10=
00 on a used bike or $700 or $400 and then (best case scenario) they buy a =
real pile o' junk from Facebook Marketplace for $120 that needs $300 in rep=
air to make it suck just a tiny bit less. Worst case, they end up with a pi=
ece of trash that can't get them to the end of their block, let alone their=
 shit job they=E2=80=99re trying to unionize. But we can't just give away b=
ikes to these people, right?! We have to worry about things like rent and e=
lectricity and payroll so that our people can pay rent and electricity. But=
 what if we could? What if we could say "this bike is $1000 and I know you =
can only afford $300 but if you can scrape together $500 we'll give you thi=
s $1000 bike for $500 because there's a community of people who think that =
a couple hundred bucks shouldn't be the difference between a life changing =
dream machine and a market street flat factory.=E2=80=9D This works a littl=
e different from our regular membership program - it=E2=80=99s a one time (=
or however often your heart desires) donation that will be used to subsidiz=
e Quercus bikes for folks. We will give a bike away - we have no problem gi=
ving things away generally but we like the idea of folks having a little sk=
in in the game - we will ask people what they can afford, can they squeeze =
a bit more than that? And we=E2=80=99ll (you=E2=80=99ll) take care of the r=
est. Do we have any way to keep people from taking advantage of us or using=
 us when they=E2=80=99re not really in need? Nah. And, honestly, we=E2=80=
=99re not really worried about it. We=E2=80=99re not your republican dads, =
man. Let=E2=80=99s take care of each other and remember that even if we get=
 swindled from time to time, it will be worth it 10 times over. You can fin=
d the details for our new program, and read about our other membership tier=
