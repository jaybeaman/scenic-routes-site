ampaign_sent_date=3D2025-05-04T06%3A18%3A26Z> Take 9, May 3rd 2025 Slow New=
s. Hi Neighbors, Tomorrow is my birthday. When I was turning eight years ol=
d I planned a birthday party with my mom, went to school with my backpack f=
ull of invitations, handed them out to the kids in my class, and waited in =
excited anticipation. I was too cool for an RSVP, I said, =E2=80=9CMOM, Nob=
ody wants to RSVP, people will just come.=E2=80=9D Crazy thing is, my mom w=
as right (aren=E2=80=99t they always), and nobody showed up except my best =
friend. Turns out eight year olds don=E2=80=99t put things on their parent=
=E2=80=99s calendar for them. Turns out I wasn=E2=80=99t too cool for an RS=
VP; I was heartbroken. My mom took me to the movies with my best friend and=
 I ate enough cake to make my stomach hurt and the year after I did include=
 a note to PLEASE RSVP on my invitations. Since then, I haven=E2=80=99t bee=
n much of a birthday girl. The planning seems like more hassle than it=E2=
=80=99s worth and asking people to celebrate me makes me uncomfortable in a=
 way that can probably only be explained in therapy. I just want to have a =
nice day. Eat a nice meal, ride my bike, bake a cake, and spend a little mo=
re money on myself than I usually would. Unfortunately, the world doesn=E2=
=80=99t revolve around me, and living in a community has taught me that eve=
n your birthday isn=E2=80=99t yours alone to enjoy. People need to be given=
 a reason to get together: to hold hands and hug and remember that the worl=
d is actually full of joy. People want to show you they care, and sometimes=
 you need to give them a day, a time, and a location to do so. Which is to =
say: You=E2=80=99re Invited! Night Moves - Birthday Edition Thursday, May 8=
th 521 Balboa Street Meet at 7:15, Roll at 7:30 I=E2=80=99m turning 23, whi=
ch is nice. It puts me solidly into my 20s in a way that almost makes me fe=
el like a real adult. Jay is turning 51 two days later, which is also nice =
in that it puts him solidly into adulthood in a way that makes his musings =
more wise than wishful. One such musing was that it was important to invite=
 people to celebrate us. That we should have a ride that isn=E2=80=99t just=
 a ride, isn=E2=80=99t just another Thursday, but is a reason to get togeth=
er and have a jolly good time with our friends and neighbors. Life is busy =
and the world is full of stress, but I=E2=80=99m happy to be another year o=
lder. I=E2=80=99m happy to witness Jay turn another year older. Marking the=
 passage of time is painful, and requires reflection that sometimes feels i=
mpossible to do given the circumstances of society, but usually ends up bei=
ng worth it. I=E2=80=99m so scared to be 8 years old again at my birthday p=
arty with a table set for 10 and only have one kid show up that I don=E2=80=
=99t want to give people the opportunity to celebrate me. But, we are all l=
earning and growing, and this year I=E2=80=99ve decided that even if only o=
ne kid shows up, I=E2=80=99ll consider myself lucky. What a gift to share e=
ach other=E2=80=99s company on a day that could=E2=80=99ve been just anothe=
r Tuesday. What a gift to be alive. Two years ago at the end of May a group=
 of us gathered down at Ocean Beach to celebrate the birthdays of Kat and H=
ansel. (Why were we all born in May?? Will one of the astrology girls tell =
me?). If I remember correctly, Hansel was not thrilled to be the center of =
attention (though we all know they secretly were), felt bad about asking ev=
eryone to be there on a foggy day, and had been talked into having a party.=
 What an idiot. If only we had one more birthday party in which we could he=
ar Hansel=E2=80=99s laugh, take 700 selfies, and see their smile light up t=
he entire beach. The world would be a better place. My heart would be a lit=
tle less broken. Our community would be a little bit stronger. Hansel had a=
 way of making every day feel like a celebration, so you can only imagine t=
he way a day as auspicious as a birthday could feel. We cannot stop living =
in light of those we have lost. We cannot stop celebrating. In fact, I thin=
k we must celebrate more. Let=E2=80=99s ride our bikes to the top of Twin P=
eaks on a Thursday with chocolate cake in our baskets and call it a party b=
ecause we CAN. Let=E2=80=99s get together on Sunday=E2=80=99s and drink tea=
 and call it a soiree because no one is stopping us. Let=E2=80=99s wear our=
 cute outfits and turn up the music and send each other cards and dance in =
the bike shop and make our mundane lives a little more magical. You deserve=
 it, and the people who love you deserve it too. So come to our birthday ri=
de, and plan your own birthday party. Let this be your push to get together=
 with your friends in a way that isn=E2=80=99t just sitting on the couch wa=
tching TV or running errands. Life is all work and no fun unless you do som=
ething about it. Let=E2=80=99s have a party! And Jay=E2=80=99s only request=
 for this letter about both of our birthdays was that I sign off with the f=
ollowing: Celebrate. Good times. Come on. Ayla P.S. Other things happening =
this month: Rotating Mechanic=E2=80=99s Class! Thursday May 15th at 7:15 As=
 a gift to myself (this is the day before my final Graduate thesis is due) =
we are phoning it in a bit for this class: Have you ever looked at our bike=
s and thought, WOW, I wish my bike was cute like that. Now it can be! Come =
deck your bike out with all the cuteness your heart could desire. Yassify y=
our bike, if you will. You bring your bike, leave with a bike you don=E2=80=

with my best friend and I ate enough cake to make my stomach hurt and the y=
ear after I did include a note to PLEASE RSVP on my invitations.&nbsp;<br><=

a group of us gathered down at Ocean Beach to celebrate the birthdays of Ka=
t and Hansel. (Why were we all born in May?? Will one of the astrology girl=
s tell me?). If I remember correctly, Hansel was not thrilled to be the cen=
ter of attention (though we all know they secretly were), felt bad about as=
king everyone to be there on a foggy day, and had been talked into having a=
 party. What an idiot. If only we had one more birthday party in which we c=
ould hear Hansel=E2=80=99s laugh, take 700 selfies, and see their smile lig=
ht up the entire beach. The world would be a better place. My heart would b=
e a little less broken. Our community would be a little bit stronger. Hanse=
l had a way of making every day feel like a celebration, so you can only im=
agine the way a day as auspicious as a birthday could feel.&nbsp;</p><p sty=
