-11-17T17%3A41%3A13Z> Take 3, November 16th, 2024 Slow News. Hi Neighbors! =
YOU=E2=80=99RE INVITED TO A SCENIC ROUTES CHRISTMAS PARTY!!!! Date: Decembe=
r 12th, 2024 Time: 6:00pm to 9:00pm Destination: 521 Balboa Street, San Fra=
ncisco, CA, 94118 There will be live music, handmade tamales, a two tiered =
cake, Mary=E2=80=99s punch bowl, ornaments hung on the tree, and a room ful=
l of neighbors gathering to spread some good cheer. On Thursday night, as I=
 rode away from our second ever Night Moves, I had tears in my eyes and a s=
mile on my face that not even the November chill could touch. Forty people =
gathered under a little shelter at Mountain Lake Park and allowed us to ser=
ve them soup that we made in our own kitchens, with our own hands, just for=
 them. Just for YOU. As I stood on the little green park bench to thank eve=
ryone for coming, what I saw in front of me was community in action. People=
 who had never met were literally breaking bread together. Bread, might I a=
dd, that our very own Luke Spray baked just for the occasion. Stories were =
shared, bowls were shared, and smiles were shared as strangers became frien=
ds. Thursday night was a smashing success, but it was also just a small gli=
mmer of what=E2=80=99s possible when people allow themselves the opportunit=
y to be cared for. Riding around the city at night in the cold with a group=
 of strangers doesn=E2=80=99t sound all that exciting when I put it like th=
at, but what we had was an adventure. We pushed our bodies, we withstood th=
e elements, and we nourished our bodies and spirits at the end of it. Our n=
ext opportunity to do this in a community setting is, of course, our annual=
 Christmas party. I know that many of us are feeling the weight of the worl=
d on our shoulders as we embark on another four years of constant reminders=
 that there are members of our country who don=E2=80=99t believe communitie=
s like ours should exist and thrive. The world is a tragic, shocking, and e=
mbarrassing thing, but there is room for joy, and it exists in the pockets =
of our universe that we choose to inhabit and take care of. Even on good ye=
ars, the holidays often come with their own unique set of baggage for each =
of us; reminders of financial strain, explosive relationships with family m=
embers, dark days and cold nights, the denial of our identities chalked up =
to differences in politics, and of course, the overwhelming sadness of bein=
g an adult and having to stuff your own damn stocking. The obligation that =
many of us feel to our biological families can be overwhelming, and keeping=
 your mouth shut in the name of keeping traditions alive is a noble goal, b=
ut your traditions can expand beyond the grip of blood relatives. I speak f=
or all of us at Scenic Routes when I say that you are welcome to be a part =
of our holiday celebrations, just as you are. We will invite you into our f=
ront doors, turn on the heater to keep you nice and warm, listen to your st=
ories of triumph, joy, and hardship from the year past, and help you dream =
of a brighter future for the year in front of us. We will share a meal and =
company, and raise our glasses to a tiny example of a beautiful way of life=
 in an ugly world. Please do us the honor of making the Scenic Routes Chris=
tmas Party a tradition that fills you with joy throughout the year by graci=
ng us with your presence. If you CAN=E2=80=99T make it to the Christmas par=
ty, (and even if you can!!) we=E2=80=99d love to send you a good ol=E2=80=
=99 fashion Christmas card. Click the little box below to add your address =
to our list and receive your very own snail mail from Scenic Routes. Addres=

n other, less sappy news, if you ordered a crewneck, they are coming!! In m=
ere days. If you ordered for delivery, your package will simply arrive on y=
our doorstep as a sweet surprise, and if you ordered for pickup, you=E2=80=
=99ll get a separate email inviting you to swing by the shop at your earlie=
st convenience. Be on the lookout! Also coming to the shop, Cleverhood rain=
 capes (In children and adult sizes), new helmets, squeezy bean brakes, and=
 lots of other goodies that are perfect for your Christmas present needs. E=
xpect a gift guide in the coming weeks. Maybe in your email, maybe on the w=
ebsite, I haven=E2=80=99t decided yet. The winter is hard for local bike sh=
ops, and it would mean the world to us if we happen to end up on the Christ=
mas list you send your grandma. We have an online shop, offer gift cards, a=
nd generally have a shorter queue than we do during the summer (just saying=
). Thanks for helping us thrive and grow every season of the year, we are s=
o looking forward to these cozy months with you in our lives. As we gear up=
 for the holidays, I wanted to share Jay=E2=80=99s recipe for his mushroom =
wild rice soup per the requests from Thursday night. If any of you have any=
 holiday meal prep questions, text the shop and we=E2=80=99ll send you a we=
ll thought out response to make everyone at your dinner table go back for s=

under a little shelter at Mountain Lake Park and allowed us to serve them s=

 coming, what I saw in front of me was community in action. People who had =
never met were literally breaking bread together. Bread, might I add, that =
our very own Luke Spray baked just for the occasion. Stories were shared, b=
owls were shared, and smiles were shared as strangers became friends.&nbsp;=
