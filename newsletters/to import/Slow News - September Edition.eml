3A53%3A24Z> Take 12, September 6th 2025 Slow News. Hey Neighbors, Lately, w=
hen people ask me what I want to do in the future, I tell them that, honest=
ly, the one thing that sparks joy in my heart is to be a cargo bike mom. I =
dream of living in a world where my future children are raised with intenti=
onality, community, and love. I want their commute to school to be filled w=
ith views of JFK and smiling neighbors, not the roof of a minivan. I want t=
o hop onto the bus with one child in a stroller and another in a carrier an=
d make our way across the city to see the bay. I want the journey to be fil=
led with interesting sights and people and no concerns for traffic. I want =
them to feel connected to their world, to understand their city, and to kno=
w the individuals that make up their community. One thing that I love about=
 bikes is that they expand your access to the world tenfold. No longer are =
you stuck in the mindless slog to and from your designated places of attend=
ance - work, the grocery store, the gym, the bank, etc., but the entire cit=
y is yours to explore. You can get through the park and make as many detour=
s onto the winding dirt trails as your heart desires, you can stop at the l=
ibrary because the warm glow of the lights makes reading a book feel oh so =
inviting, you can visit your third coffee shop of the day for a mid-ride ca=
ppuccino because at least you aren=E2=80=99t spending $65 to fill up your t=
ank with gas. There is no fear of not finding parking, of being late, or of=
 breaking the rules, there is only independence and joy. When I moved to Sa=
n Francisco, I was afraid. Afraid of the size, afraid of the people, afraid=
 of parking tickets and harassment and my car being broken into. When I sta=
rted biking, my fears dissipated nearly overnight. It was like I had been l=
ooking at a facade of the city and when I started pedaling the curtain drop=
ped and I could see. My heart rate steadied, my mind became calm, and my op=
inion not only shifted, but became passionately in favor of the city I call=
ed home. Scenic Routes became an anchor that I could tether myself to as I =
set off on my new quest to explore the city on two wheels. I knew that wher=
ever the handlebars took me, I could point them back to 521 Balboa Street a=
t the end of the day and land in the soft embrace of friendship, thoughtful=
 guidance, and a shared understanding of the world I was trying to cultivat=
e. As I=E2=80=99ve moved through the roles of customer to friend to volunte=
er to employee to manager, I have remained steadfast in my gratitude for wh=
at Scenic Routes has done for me. It has transformed my understanding of Sa=
n Francisco, of cities, and of myself. Scenic Routes has watched me grow up=
 at the same time as I have helped shape it into the space it is today. =E2=
=80=9CWe are all learning and growing=E2=80=9D is our motto at the shop any=
time we do something that could be classified as a mistake. We are all lear=
ning and growing, and what a gift to do so while being held just tight enou=
gh that our wings can still open without the fear of falling. I will contin=
ue to set my sights on the dream of mothering my children in a world that i=
s soft and radical and full of love, and until then, I will continue to lea=
rn and grow and cultivate the world that I want them to have access to. Our=
 events every month are my favorite reminder that what we are doing is work=
ing. Our attempts to create an alternative space in the world of cycling th=
at is detached from goals of athleticism or stats or weight are becoming a =
reality. This month, we are kicking off our monthly family bike ride: QUERC=

miling neighbors, not the roof of a minivan. I want to hop onto the bus wit=

the city to see the bay. I want the journey to be filled with interesting s=

om your designated places of attendance - work, the grocery store, the gym,=
 the bank, etc., but the entire city is yours to explore. You can get throu=
gh the park and make as many detours onto the winding dirt trails as your h=
eart desires, you can stop at the library because the warm glow of the ligh=
ts makes reading a book feel oh so inviting, you can visit your third coffe=
e shop of the day for a mid-ride cappuccino because at least you aren=E2=80=

 see. My heart rate steadied, my mind became calm, and my opinion not only =
shifted, but became passionately in favor of the city I called home. Scenic=
 Routes became an anchor that I could tether myself to as I set off on my n=
ew quest to explore the city on two wheels. I knew that wherever the handle=
bars took me, I could point them back to 521 Balboa Street at the end of th=
