A29%3A53Z> Take 16, January 3rd, 2026 Slow News. Hi Neighbors, This month, =
it=E2=80=99s me, Jay. My grandma smoked More 120s, those long brown cigaret=
tes that looked like something a villain would hold in a film about divorce=
, and she drank scotch with water on the rocks, and she was a monster. She =
used to say I can't win for losing with you and she meant it as a knife. Bu=
t here's the thing about that phrase, that idiom, that little piece of pois=
on dressed up as folksy resignation: it's stupid. It's grammatically and sp=
iritually stupid. You can win for losing. You can win while losing. You can=
 win because of losing, or in spite of it, or alongside it, the way joy sit=
s next to grief at the same table and neither one asks the other to leave. =
I got married last week. I got married last week and it was beautiful and p=
erfect and there's a war in Gaza and children are being buried under rubble=
 and America is eating itself from the inside out, again, still, forever ma=
ybe, and the world is a dumpster fire dressed in a flag, and I stood in fro=
nt of the people I love and promised myself to a woman who cackles. She cac=
kles, joyfully, the way villains do in movies except she's not a villain, s=
he's just someone who cackles. I celebrate while many things degrade. I'm g=
oing to be happy in a burning room because the room is always burning, the =
room has always been on fire, and you can either drink your scotch and tell=
 everyone they're the reason you can't win or you can dance anyway (except =
while I did dance, I don=E2=80=99t know about dancing, you guys). Mary aske=
d me once if I was worried that someday she'd be sick of me. Yes, I said. O=
f course. Yes. And she said she'd never be sick of me, she swore it, and I =
said: but I'll be old. Cantankerous. Crusty. Broken. I'll have dementia, pr=
obably, God forbid, and I'll be mean. I can already feel the seedlings of i=
t in me, the places where I'm hardening, the spots that will calcify into s=
omething sharp and difficult. I will be a problem. I will be a burden. I wi=
ll forget your name and say cruel things and not remember saying them. And =
Mary said: Me too! And then: Are you gonna be sick of me? And I said: Of co=
urse. Of course I will. But I'm not worried about it. I'm okay with being s=
ick of you. Because that's the thing my grandma never understood, with her =
long brown cigarettes and her ice cubes melting into the scotch and her phr=
ases designed to wound: you can win for losing. You can be sick of someone =
and still choose them. You can watch the world collapse and still get marri=
ed. You can hold despair in one hand and hope in the other and you don't ha=
ve to put either one down. Losing doesn't prohibit your ability to win. It =
never did. I can't win for losing, she said, and she was wrong. She was wro=
ng about so much. I can win. I am winning. I will win even when I'm losing,=
 especially when I'm losing, because Mary cackles like someone who knows th=
e joke and the joke is that we're all hurtling towards death and we get to =
love each other anyway. My grandma is dead now. The cigarettes got her or t=
he scotch got her or the cruelty got her or just time got her, the way time=
 gets everyone, and I don't miss her. I don't miss her and I got married la=
st week and the world is a nightmare and I am happy and these things are al=
l true at once. Jay We are all winning because we live in San Francisco, be=
cause we have each other, because we know the joy of the bicycle. We are wi=
nning because we have unlocked the secret of community. We have discovered =
the unforgettable feeling of riding to the beach at night with a group of f=
riends to drink a cup of tea while classical music carries through the fog.=
 This Thursday, January 8th, we are leading our FIRST ANNUAL =E2=80=9CTo th=
e Beach and Bach=E2=80=9D Night Moves Community Bike Ride (what a mouthful =
geez). There will be Bach, there will be radios strapped to racks, thrown i=
n baskets, and balanced on shoulders (if we=E2=80=99re really feeling the v=
ibe). There will be hot tea and cider. There will be an accompaniment of ti=
res on pavement, and there will be YOU. Bring your lights (if you=E2=80=99v=
e got em), bring a mug, bring a jacket (or two), and bring the whimsy that =
exists within you, that makes you cackle at the moon and bask in the glory =
of the night. Meet at 521 Balboa Street @ 7:15 Roll at 7:30 Leave with joy =
in your heart, musics in your ears, and memories in your mind. Add to your =
Calendar!  <https://calendar.app.google/enYEKpB5aHQQdvRU9> On the 15th, we=
=E2=80=99ll be teaching this month=E2=80=99s rotating Mechanic=E2=80=99s Cl=
ass. This month=E2=80=99s topic - Tubeless Repair. We=E2=80=99ll teach you =
everything you need to know to patch your tubeless holes and rips and gashe=
s. We=E2=80=99ll show you how to add sealant and keep your wheels rollin=E2=

shop with a new set of skills. Sign up Here!  <https://www.scenicroutessf.c=

mmunity Night. 7:00 to 9:00. Stop by, have a drink, join a conversation, an=

soon, we beg. We yearn to be in your presence, all of you, all at once, or =
one at a time. Our hearts are full when we lead a ride of 65 people, and wh=
