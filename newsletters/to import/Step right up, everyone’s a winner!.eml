 Let=E2=80=99s get back to the long rambling text full of sweet sorrow and =
longing for community. We, as in we at Scenic Routes, are never going to tr=
y to sell you something. We are never going to push bikes on you or make yo=
u buy the Latest! Fastest! Sleakest! gear. We believe strongly in doing the=
 work that needs to be done to make your bicycle function in order to serve=
 you. We believe in stocking things on our shelves that will make people=E2=
=80=99s lives better and easier and more fun. We also, unfortunately, are p=
roducts of our environment and love to buy buy buy! We love trinkets and ga=
dgets and doodads and bits and bobs and things, and, we love our bikes. So,=
 trinkets and gadgets and doodads and bits and bobs that are a celebration =
of our bikes are a no brainer. Everyone should carry a water bottle while r=
iding their bikes, so why not offer one that is free from plastic and will =
last you a lifetime? Everyone living in San Francisco should own a crewneck=
 (or 10), so why not offer one that is thoughtfully designed and embroidere=
d locally? In other words, while there may be no ethical consumption under =
capitalism there is scab consumerism under capitalism and Amazon (and the l=
ikes of it) is definitely a union busting company. So maybe buy your junk a=

 but your 300 square foot apartment doesn=E2=80=99t have the capacity for o=
ne more piece of bike gear, you might want to consider becoming a Scenic Ro=
utes member, or making a contribution to our =E2=80=9CYou get a Quercus=E2=

shop and tells me that the newsletter from that month made them smile, or w=
hen a child brings their bike in to adorn it with =E2=80=98slow is forever=
=E2=80=99 stickers, or when a person who attended one of my flat fix classe=
s returns months later to tell me that they successfully patched a tube on =
their way to work. These are the moments we are working for, and selling st=
uff just happens to be a part of the job. The other, vastly more fulfilling=
 part of the job is creating moments for us to exist together. On the calen=
dar coming up there is: FLAT FIX CLASS! Thursday, August 7th, 7:15pm This m=

%3A24Z> COMMUNITY NIGHT Thursday, August 28th, 7:00pm This is your invitati=
on to make your way into the shop for no other reason than to take up space=
=2E Tell us your stories, ask us your q=
uestions, drink our beer, and let us b=
ask in the light of your company. DAY GROOVES QUEER COMMUNITY BIKE RIDE Sun=
day, August 31st Meet at 10:45, Roll at 11:00. Bring your bike, yourself, a=
nd all your good vibes. We=E2=80=99re going to cruise through the presidio =
and end somewhere with a view. I=E2=80=99m riding my cargo bike and (maybe)=
 bringing Bennie. Let=E2=80=99s cruise along the scenic routes and fill our=
 hearts with the joy of using our bodies for simple pleasures. QUERCUS FAMI=
LY BIKE RIDE - a ride for every member of your family tree. Sunday, Septemb=
er 7th Meet at 9:00, Roll at 9:15 Starting at - the =E2=80=98LOVE=E2=80=99 =
blocks in front of the Conservatory of Flowers on JFK Blvd. Ending at - the=
 meadow across from Metson Lake on Middle Drive. Join us for a slow rollin=
=E2=80=99 good time. There will be bubbles, kid=E2=80=99s tunes, and a stor=
y time featuring a book about bikes at the end! Kids on balance bikes, peda=
l bikes, scooters, and cargo bikes are all welcome. All ages may attend, an=
d we will pick a pace to accommodate our littlest riders! Bring a picnic bl=
anket, some snacks, water bottles, and whatever else you think you and your=
 family may need to have a good time. This ride will happen the first Sunda=
y of each month. Put it on your calendars and get excited! Scenic Routes is=
 continuing to grow and thrive, and it is 100% a result of people showing u=
p and participating in our community. Someone described our shop as an =E2=
=80=9Cexchange=E2=80=9D rather than a business, and I can only hope that on=
e day we will reach what is an equitable back and forth that leaves us all =
with gratitude, joy, love, and hope (there=E2=80=99s that hope I was talkin=
g about). Being an anti-profit business sets us up for what some could only=
 call failure, but when we approach our work as an exchange of effort and e=
nergy and time and attention and money and goods, we can appreciate the fac=
t that our success has only just begun. We are here because of you, and we =
are here for you. Thank you for participating in our business and our world=
 and our lives. I=E2=80=99ll be in your inbox next month. And maybe I=E2=80=
=99ll see you before then (I can only HOPE). Ayla Visit Our Site!  <https:/=
