4%3A05%3A32Z> Take 6, February 4th Slow News. Hi Neighbors, I=E2=80=99m sit=
ting cross legged on my little wooden chair in my little makeshift office t=
hat doubles as my craft room (and my closet) in my little apartment in my l=
ittle neighborhood and I want you to know that I feel the weight of my word=
s. I want to say something meaningful for you to cling onto. I want to say =
something that inspires hope. I want to say something so that I can say I d=
id something. I feel like I need to say something, or maybe like I=E2=80=99=
m supposed to say something; something about Trump, something about Palesti=
ne, something about climate change and late stage capitalism and the LA fir=
es and the car crash on 8th and Balboa and the collapse of community and th=
e fear our trans community is feeling and the hurt our sisters are experien=
cing and the pain of being alive as a person who has compassion in a world =
that is built on the backs of our neighbors. I want to say something so you=
 know I hear you and I see you, but the truth is, everyone is saying someth=
ing, and I=E2=80=99m not sure any of it actually means anything. And as I s=
it here feeling the weight of my words and my platform, there is a pile of =
dishes sitting in my sink, but I can=E2=80=99t bring myself to wash them be=
cause the hot water burns the microscopic cuts I=E2=80=99ve accumulated dur=
ing the week of bike mechanic-ery and the sting reminds me that I am just a=
 girl. And then instead of the weight of my words I feel the weight of my g=
irlhood; the weight of my queerness; the weight of my disability; the weigh=
t of existing in a soft human body in a world that is being run by those wi=
th access to machines of destruction. It=E2=80=99s unfortunate, really, tha=
t I feel the need (i.e. obligation, desire, urge) to say something about th=
e world at large, because what I really want to say something about is our =
bike shop. I want to sing to you all about the queer couple that was visiti=
ng from Idaho and borrowed two Quercus bikes to ride across the Golden Gate=
 Bridge together. I can=E2=80=99t, however, tell you that story in good fai=
th without telling you that they came to San Francisco for the weekend to p=
retend, for just a moment, that they are not societal outcasts who have bee=
n deemed =E2=80=98other.=E2=80=99 I want the world to hear me laugh as I te=
ll you about Atlas hurling himself off the couch because he was so excited =
to see the first customer of the day, but I don=E2=80=99t have time for suc=
h miniscule stories at a time like this. I want to raise my hands and shout=
 about the 6 year old who is patiently waiting to grow two more inches so s=
he can fit on a bike with gears, but my heart aches to think of her future =
when there are no more inches to grow and the magic of childhood has disapp=
eared into a fever dream with little resemblance to her reality. And as I s=
it at my little desk in my little apartment and write my words that feel he=
avy, I am drinking a cup of my favorite tea that I brewed in an attempt to =
sooth my shaking fingertips and lower my overactive heart beat. The tea bag=
s were picked up by Emily during her 9:00pm commute because on our usual gr=
ocery run I put a new-to-me tea in the basket, (in an attempt to shake thin=
gs up! get crazy! expand my palate and my mind and my experience of the wor=
ld!) and I hated it. I drank two cups with a sour look on my face and did n=
ot return for a third, and while the warmth of my mug in my hands is bringi=
ng me comfort tonight, the thought of my girlfriend taking pity on me is a =
much sweeter balm for my weary soul. So, I take a deep breath in and I sip =
my tea and I write my words and then I wonder if I=E2=80=99ll be able to ma=
ke my girlfriend my wife in the next four years. Suddenly, I need a bigger =
cup of tea. In moments like these, moments where my mind is consuming itsel=
f with dark thoughts and wild imaginary solutions to widely unbelievable tr=
uths, I wish I was on my bike. When I started visiting the bike shop, well =
before my days of newsletter writing, bike building, and ride leading, I wa=
s often going in search of a soft place to land. After patiently listening =
to my melodramatic woes, Jay would tell me to go get on my bike. Even if I =
had =E2=80=98better things=E2=80=99 to do, even if my body hurt, even if th=
e rain was coming down in a flurry, he would tell me that riding my bike fo=
r two hours wouldn=E2=80=99t fix all my problems, but it would fix all my p=
roblems for two hours. I rolled my eyes. I resisted. I thought he was being=
 a bit of a quack about the whole thing, but I would get on my bike anyway.=
 I would ride and be filled to the brim with anger and annoyance and a vary=
ing degree of =E2=80=9CI told you so=E2=80=99s.=E2=80=9D I would ride and s=
uddenly my elevated heart rate was a byproduct of my excursion just as much=
 as my anxiety. I would ride and eventually the ringing in my ears would be=
 replaced with the reliable swish of bike tires on pavement and my unlubed =
chain rubbing against my cassette. I would ride and although I was starting=
 and ending my ride at exactly the same location, I had spent two hours mov=
ing forward in the world. My advice (my thing that I=E2=80=99m going to say=
) is to keep moving forward in the world. Keep showing up for your communit=
y, for your friends, and for yourself. Don=E2=80=99t let the magnitude of i=
t all keep you from making minuscule differences. Every time you smile at y=
our neighbor, you're creating change in the world. Every time you offer an =
ounce of kindness to a child, you are establishing a truth that the world i=
s not, in fact, all cruel. Take care of a cat, paint a picture, plant nativ=
e flowers, ride your bike, cook a meal, mend your friend=E2=80=99s clothes,=
 water your plants, sweep the floor, read a book, listen to a new artist, o=
r do anything. Maybe you need help doing something, and that=E2=80=99s okay=
 too, because my something is creating space and time for you to gather and=
 act. We don=E2=80=99t host free classes because we think all of you need t=
o learn how to fix a flat tire, but because we think learning how to fix so=
mething might be exactly the thing some of you need. And maybe teaching som=
ething is exactly what we need. Our Flat Class is the first Thursday of the=
 month. It is free and silly and available for all of you. You can sign up =
here. We can talk about flat tires or your grandma or your childhood best f=
riend or what you ate for lunch. Your hands will get dirty in a way that wi=
ll make you feel like you did something and the class only ends when each a=
nd every person who signed up has had success in changing a flat tire. You =
can sign up below. Flat Class!  <https://www.scenicroutessf.com/goodsandcla=

 learn will come in handy on a long bike ride or perhaps in the case of the=
 apocalypse. I'm stitching first aid kits for each of you and my mom is com=
ing in to teach the class. We will listen to your fears and your worries ab=
out being out on the trails and give you real, tangible tools to increase y=
our confidence and your repertoire. We should all strive for the ability to=
 take care of each other, and while this class is just a starting point, we=
 will all leave better than we came. Sign up below. Pay what you want/can. =

deemed =E2=80=9CMy bike is my Valentine=E2=80=9D and there will be heart sh=
aped cookies for all. There will also be chocolate, hot tea, and maybe a ha=
ndwritten love note or two (feel free to bring your own!). And most importa=
ntly of all, there will be an abundance of love for our bikes and our commu=
nity. We meet at 7:15, roll at 7:30. We are tackling Twin Peaks. It might s=
ound scary, but if you came on the soup ride, you can ride twin peaks. We=
=E2=80=99ll go slow, take breaks, and have a designated walker to join all =
of you who decide it isn=E2=80=99t the time to conquer new heights. We=E2=
=80=99ll get to the top in however long it takes and get to bask in the joy=
 of being where not even the cars can go. The camp stoves will be burnin=E2=
=80=99 and we won=E2=80=99t run out this time (I PROMISE!!). Bring your glo=
ves and a jacket and someone you love. This month=E2=80=99s Day Grooves is =
going to tackle the dirt on Sunday, February 23rd! Have the trials in GGP b=
een calling out to you, but nerves have kept you away? I=E2=80=99ll hold yo=
ur hand, prepare you for every turn, and hoot and holler at every success. =
We=E2=80=99ll go slow, take turns, and share snacks when we get to the beac=
h. Music will be playing, Atlas will be barking, and the vibes will be glow=
ing. We meet at 10:45, roll at 11. If you love us and our vibe and want to =
spend time in community with us when we aren=E2=80=99t frantically trying t=
o finish our work for the day, make bikes shine, and clean up our greasy me=
ssy, but have no interest in classes or group rides (it's okay, I=E2=80=99m=
 not offended) you can always join us the last Thursday of the month for co=
mmunity night. We turn the music up, bring the beer (and la croix) out, and=
 spend a couple of hours sharing stories and company. Thursday the 27th at =
7pm. View the Calendar  <https://www.scenicroutessf.com/calendar?ss_source=

my little desk in my little apartment and write my words that feel heavy, I=
 am drinking a cup of my favorite tea that I brewed in an attempt to sooth =
my shaking fingertips and lower my overactive heart beat. The tea bags were=
 picked up by Emily during her 9:00pm commute because on our usual grocery =
run I put a new-to-me tea in the basket, (in an attempt to shake things up!=
 get crazy! expand my palate and my mind and my experience of the world!) a=
nd I hated it. I drank two cups with a sour look on my face and did not ret=
urn for a third, and while the warmth of my mug in my hands is bringing me =
comfort tonight, the thought of my girlfriend taking pity on me is a much s=
weeter balm for my weary soul. So, I take a deep breath in and I sip my tea=
 and I write my words and then I wonder if I=E2=80=99ll be able to make my =
girlfriend my wife in the next four years. Suddenly, I need a bigger cup of=
 tea.</p> </td>=20

these, moments where my mind is consuming itself with dark thoughts and wil=

e. When I started visiting the bike shop, well before my days of newsletter=
 writing, bike building, and ride leading, I was often going in search of a=
 soft place to land. After patiently listening to my melodramatic woes, Jay=
 would tell me to go get on my bike. Even if I had =E2=80=98better things=
=E2=80=99 to do, even if my body hurt, even if the rain was coming down in =
a flurry, he would tell me that<strong> riding my bike for two hours wouldn=
=E2=80=99t fix all my problems, but it would fix all my problems for two ho=
urs.</strong> I rolled my eyes. I resisted. I thought he was being a bit of=
 a quack about the whole thing, but I would get on my bike anyway. I would =
ride and be filled to the brim with anger and annoyance and a varying degre=
e of =E2=80=9CI told you so=E2=80=99s.=E2=80=9D I would ride and suddenly m=
y elevated heart rate was a byproduct of my excursion just as much as my an=
xiety. I would ride and eventually the ringing in my ears would be replaced=
 with the reliable swish of bike tires on pavement and my unlubed chain rub=
bing against my cassette. I would ride and although I was starting and endi=
ng my ride at exactly the same location, I had spent two hours moving forwa=
rd in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> </td>=20

the trails and give you real, tangible tools to increase your confidence an=
