A11%3A34Z> Take 15, December 4th, 2025 Slow News. Hi Neighbors, Although it=
 is undeniably clich=C3=A9 to say, I cannot believe that December is upon u=
s; the season of dinners and parties and hosting and music and lights and f=
enders and cold hands and muddy tires. When the sun started setting barely =
an hour after we eat lunch, my heart lurched at the departure of warmth and=
 iced matchas and my cats laying in the sunbeams that cast themselves acros=
s my apartment=E2=80=99s floors. Change is often unpleasant, even when we s=
hould be anticipating it long before it makes itself known, even when the r=
eality of the change isn=E2=80=99t all that unpleasant at all. But I was st=
uck in my sore mood and the unhappiness of being cold and wishing away the =
inevitable, cyclical change of seasons. I=E2=80=99m still cold, and Lily, w=
ho is more grandma than millenial and thinks a jacket should suffice, won=
=E2=80=99t let us turn on the heater at the shop (and gives me dirty looks =
when I even suggest it), but my mood has shifted. Last week, I was riding d=
own Page Street on my way home from work, well after the dog walkers and jo=
ggers had abandoned the lanes for the shelter of their Victorian apartments=
=2E My tires were sticky on the wet pav=
ement and made a delicate squelching n=
oise as my glasses collected droplets from the foggy air. The air smelled l=
ike the soil of a damp redwood forest and the city was so silent it was imp=
ossible to imagine the infinite lives existing within a seven-mile-radius o=
f me. I was alone with my bicycle surrounded by a drizzling night in the pl=
ace that I call home, and I felt at home. My hands were cold, but only enou=
gh to remind me that I am alive. In that moment on Page Street, I was overc=
ome by gratitude that this absolute joy ride was my commute home from my jo=
b doing what I love with people that I love serving my community that I lov=
e. The winter evenings give us a reason to make soup for our neighbors, the=
 crisp mornings make a cup of tea in bed all the more enticing, and the dar=
k nights make even our commutes home feel magical. There is a trope in the =
bike shop world that winter is dead. No one is riding and the work is dried=
 up. We certainly have fewer bikes in the queue than we did six months ago,=
 but the shop has never felt more alive to me. We are building Quercus Bike=
s at a rate never seen before, our friend Jesper is making new Scenic Route=
s merch, we are reimagining the layout of the shop, and our rides have more=
 people attending every month. The thing about being a community bike shop =
is that there is no off season. There is no off season for creating room fo=
r connection, for rewriting the narrative of the bicycle, and for providing=
 service to those of us who use our bikes every single day of the year, no =
matter the weather. The shop spent the last weekend of November on Angel Is=
land with 25 of you, braving the elements and making memories. I looked aro=
und at the row of tents and the campers bundled up in layers and was so pro=
ud of the world we=E2=80=99ve created - one where a ferry ride transports y=
ou to a far away land and it only takes two days for strangers to become fr=
iends. Please do us the honor of helping us close out the year on the highe=
st note yet. On December 11th at 7:00pm we will be hosting the annual Sceni=
c Routes Holiday Party. We=E2=80=99ll be moving the bikes out of the way, d=
oning our favorite Christmas sweaters, and serving up some serious holiday =
cheer. There will be a live three piece band, Mary=E2=80=99s famous punch, =
a Christmas cake, and treats covering every surface of the shop to be enjoy=
ed. You are invited to bring something to share, and we might suggest that =
you label it=E2=80=99s allergens so our gluten free, vegan, dietary restric=
tion freaks can partake without fear. There will be joy and company and lau=
ghter and warmth, so much warmth (Lily might even let us turn the heater on=
). If you can=E2=80=99t attend the Holiday Party (or even if you can!!!) pl=
ease let us send you a Christmas Card! It means the world to us to create r=
eal, tangible moments of joy, and this is one little way for us to show our=
 thanks. Pop your address down below and await something besides junk-mail =
being pushed through the mail slot. Address Form  <https://docs.google.com/=

> This Sunday, December 7th is the last Quercus Family Bike Ride of the yea=
r. We will meet at 9:00am at the Love Blocks in front of the Conservatory o=
f Flowers and bop down to Metson Lake for a story time in the grass. We rol=
l at 9:15. Bring a blanket for sitting and warm clothes for wearing! We rid=
e as slow as our slowest rider can go. Kids on balance bikes, pedal bikes, =
and cargo bikes are all welcome. (art work by one of our regular riders). A=
nd all month long we will be open for your bike needs, your sitting-on-our-=
couch needs, and your holiday shopping needs. Below, I have highlighted a f=
ew of our favorite items that would be a real treat to receive as a gift. Y=
our grandma is going to buy you something, so why not direct her towards yo=
ur favorite anti-profit bike shop? Or perhaps you need something for a Secr=
et Santa you=E2=80=99re being forced to participate in - we have doodads at=
 every price range. Or maybe this email was sent to you by your bike riding=
, tree hugging, pot smoking commie-anarchist relative out in San Francisco =
who=E2=80=99s trying to hint at what they want you to buy them. May we sugg=
est a gift certificate to everyone's favorite anti-profit community bicycle=
 center, Scenic Routes. Gift Certificates redeemed will be used exclusively=
 for bike joy. Gift certificates never redeemed will also be used exclusive=
ly for bike joy. Come by the shop, poke around, try things on, and listen t=
o the Christmas vinyls spin. Joel=E2=80=99s favorite item is Full Coverage =
Fenders. ($80) Joel says =E2=80=9CHere is why: 1- They protect you when it'=
s raining. 2- They keep you dry and clean when the ground is wet but it=E2=
=80=99s not raining. Riding on wet pavement sounds and feels so good when y=
ou stay dry. 3- They keep your bike/drivetrain clean and lessen drivetrain =
wear 4- They look so good 5- Fenders provide a perfect spot to mount your g=
enerator taillight A $100 gift certificate would cover the cost of most fen=
ders we sell and some of the install price of the plastic fenders.=E2=80=9D=
 Lily=E2=80=99s favorite item is the Park Tool AWS-1 Three-Way Hex Wrench. =
($17) Lily says =E2=80=9CI don't recommend buying gifts for your loved ones=
: I believe you should exchange dorky handmade gifts instead, as is traditi=
on. But, if you must buy a gift, consider the Park Tool AWS-1 Three-Way Hex=
 Wrench. It's more comfortable to use than a multitool or the small Allen k=
eys that come with Ikea furniture. The extra leverage is perfect for adjust=
ing rim brakes. If you want to go all out, pair a new tool with a gift card=
 to Scenic Routes: we love to help DIYers with that tricky final 10% of the=
 project.=E2=80=9D Jay=E2=80=99s favorite item is the Paul Component Brake =
Levers. ($200) Jay says =E2=80=9COkay so I'm not a gift guide person. Gift =
guides are for people who believe in solutions, and I'm more of a problems =
person, generally speaking. My feeling is you shouldn't buy stuff you don't=
 need and you really shouldn't buy other people stuff they don't need, whic=
h is basically all stuff, but here we are, alive, buying things. So if you'=
re going to do it, buy something that lasts. Buy something that will still =
be there when everything else has gone to hell, which it will. I've had the=
se Paul Component brake levers on my commuter bike for years. They've been =
through rain, grime, getting knocked over approximately ten thousand times,=
 crashes, =E2=80=9Cthe whole catastrophe=E2=80=9D as my grandma would say. =
And one of them broke, back before I owned a bike shop, back when I was jus=
t a person with a broken brake lever and a telephone. I called Paul up in C=
hico, California, and asked if I could buy the part to fix it myself. They =
sent it to me for free. I said, look, I'm pretty hard on these things. I do=
n't expect them to last forever. They said, we expect them to last forever.=
 Can you imagine? Expecting something to last forever? The audacity. The be=
autiful stupid hope of it. They've been making parts in Chico since the lat=
e eighties. Some engineer named Paul quit his real job - his real job, as i=
f making things with your hands isn't real - and bought a falling apart hou=
se with a big garage and started machining components. They still make ever=
ything there. American aluminum. Built to be fixed, not thrown away. You bu=
y them once. You repair them. You move them from bike to bike like they're =
family heirlooms, which I guess they are now (like the Buck 110 my Uncle Le=
e gave me on my 10th birthday). And eventually you forget you bought them a=
t all because they just work, quietly, asking for nothing, which is more th=
an you can say for most things in this life.=E2=80=9D SKH=E2=80=99s favorit=
e item is the Beverage Buddy. ($10) SKH says, =E2=80=9CThe bottle buddy cam=
e into my life on a last minute overnighter to China Camp when Ayla gave me=
 and Ben each one on our way out the door! It kept my stem caddy dry and my=
 spirits high as it reminded me that even a small gesture can mean a lot. G=
et a bottle buddy for you and a buddy and cheers to the small things and bi=
g friendships.=E2=80=9D Nishad=E2=80=99s favorite item is a Wald/Tanaka 137=
 or 139 Basket. ($40-60) Nishad says =E2=80=9CNothing will make you feel mo=
re smug than riding up to your holiday potluck with that pie in your front =
basket. Take in that freshly baked aroma as you roll down the street feelin=
g grateful that you didn't have to give up that coveted parking spot just t=
o get the damn pie to the party. Getting too hot for those gloves? Stop faf=
fing about with those hard-to-reach jersey pockets - just dump 'em in the b=
asket! We have 'em big, we have 'em small. We even have some half as tall.=
=E2=80=9D Beaux=E2=80=99s favorite item is a Squeezy Bean BART Brake. ($8) =
Beaux says, =E2=80=9CAs a new commuter on BART, the Squeezy Bean keeps my b=
ike in one place and makes my ride a little less chaotic. Just slip it over=
 your handle bar and pull it tight around your brake lever! It also functio=
ns as a cute bracelet when relieved of its braking duties.=E2=80=9D Ben=E2=
=80=99s favorite item is a pair of the Ornot Merino Wool Gloves. ($45) Ben =
says =E2=80=9CI wasn=E2=80=99t a daily glove guy until picking these up. Th=
ey=E2=80=99re great! The perfect amount of warm for San Francisco and all t=
he grip you need. I=E2=80=99m on my third pair (lost one, burned one, don=
=E2=80=99t ask) and they=E2=80=99re a must-replace every time.=E2=80=9D Jer=
ry=E2=80=99s favorite item is an Arno Lashing Strap. ($8-15) Jerry says, =
=E2=80=9CMade in Sweden, solid stainless steel buckles. Easy to adjust and =
cinch items down snug, I=E2=80=99ve never had one slip. I use them to strap=
 the crate that my dog rides in and other hauls of various sizes on my carg=
o bike. They=E2=80=99re also awesome for strapping a pizza to your Wald 139=
 basket on your Quercus. Bundle firewood, organize camp gear, strap your li=
fe to your favorite bike or wear a 100cm Arno strap as a belt like I do. It=
 might really save your ass one day.=E2=80=9D And as far as my favorite ite=
m goes, I don=E2=80=99t know where I would be without my Tunitas Creative S=
towaway Bag. ($60) Each and every one of my bikes is adorned with a little =
bag to compliment its colorway. Nestled right against my stem and my handle=
bars, it puts all of my treasures in perfect arm=E2=80=99s reach. Chapstick=
, phone, a handful of peanut butter pretzels, my keys, that one really cool=
 rock my favorite 4 year old gave me. I didn=E2=80=99t know how much I love=
d my stem caddies until one got stolen off my Lightning Bolt while parked i=
n front of Jay=E2=80=99s house. MY stem caddy?! My precious little treasure=
 chest?! I rode straight to the shop and bought myself a new one because I =
couldn=E2=80=99t bear the thought of being without it for my ride home. Ste=
m Caddies are perfect for commuters, long distance riders, roadies, people =
on tour, kids, and literally everyone else. The owner of Tunitas sews her b=
ags in San Francisco and delivers them by bicycle to the shop. She even buy=
s pink fabric just for us. What=E2=80=99s not to love? Of course, you don=
=E2=80=99t need to buy anything, especially not from us, but if you=E2=80=
=99re anything like me, you love stuff. Trinkets and tools and treasure, an=
d if you ARE going to buy stuff, why not buy it from us? It=E2=80=99s chall=
enging to reckon with our anti-consumerist ideals during the most consumeri=
st month of the year, but what can I say, we=E2=80=99re trying our best. Th=
e more money you spend at Scenic Routes, the more money Scenic Routes has t=
o subsidize bikes, feed people lunch, do repairs for free and host free eve=
nts. Your money is not going to waste in our hands, and also, we sell prett=
y good stuff. If you=E2=80=99re in the giving mood and want to spend some m=
oney but you got your gift shopping done months ago and you don=E2=80=99t n=
eed any more junk in your 300 square foot apartment, consider giving to the=
 =E2=80=9CYou get a Quercus Fund.=E2=80=9D We will be using the money raise=
d in December to get people, who can=E2=80=99t otherwise afford them, BIKE =
LIGHTS! Help us keep our neighbors safe and give the gift of a niterider fr=
