    <h1>Membership</h1>

    <p class="subtitle">First things, first – you absolutely DO NOT need to be a member to hang out here, get your bike worked on here or text us pictures of cool bikes in the middle of the night. But if it's something you're into, you can become a member.</p>

    <p class="subtitle">We would not put this in a class like your most hated Comcast bundle. It's best that you're not trying to get a "deal" here. This is an anarcho-socialist, mutual-aid kind of membership. We hope, and will work tirelessly to ensure, that you will feel like you really get your money's worth but we also hope that part of that calculation of "worth" includes the help that gets passed onto other folks who might need it and the promotion and support of our vision.</p>

    <p class="note">Attention ebike riders – ebikes are just bikes but they are extra (that's what the "e" stands for) and we will do our very best to service your ebike but because of their nature it may cost more for the extra labor. We are so down for the ebike revolution and want to help all bike riders achieve full bike joy.</p>

                <p class="tier-price">$??? / One-time donation</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tier-story">
                <p>Every couple of days a new, timid bright-eyed cyclist comes into shop asking if we sell used bikes and inevitably leave because they can't spend $1000 on a used bike or $700 or $400 and then (best case scenario) they buy a real pile o' junk from Facebook Marketplace for $120 that'll need $300 in repair to make it suck just a tiny bit less. Worst case, they end up with a piece of trash that can't get them to the end of their block, let alone their shit job they're trying to unionize.</p>
                <p>But we can't just give away bikes to these people, right? We have to worry about things like rent and electricity and payroll so that our people can pay rent and electricity.</p>
            </div>
            <button class="expand-btn" onclick="toggleBenefits(this)">Read more</button>
            <div class="tier-more-benefits">
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">But what if we could? What if we could say "this bike is $1000 and I know you can only afford $300 but if you can scrape together $500 we'll give you this $1000 bike for $500 because there's a community of people who think that a couple hundred bucks shouldn't be the difference between a life changing dream machine and a market street flat factory."</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">This works a little different from our regular membership program – it's a one time (or however often your heart desires) donation that will be used to subsidize Quercus bikes for folks. We will give a bike away – we have no problem giving things away generally but we like the idea of folks having a little skin in the game – we will ask people what they can afford, can they squeeze a bit more than that? And we'll (you'll) take care of the rest.</p>
                <p>Do we have any way to keep people from taking advantage of us or using us when they're not really in need? Nah. And, honestly, we're not really worried about it. We're not your republican dads, man. Let's take care of each other and remember that even if we get swindled from time to time, it will be worth it 10 times over.</p>
