    <h1>Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>
    <p class="tagline">The social contract, but for bike repair.</p>

    <div class="legal-card">
        <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> February 2026</p>
        <p><strong>The short version:</strong> We fix bikes. You pay for the bike fixing. We text you about it. Everyone is kind to each other. That's basically the whole thing, but our lawyers (Beth, her name's Beth. She's like that guy Saul but in horn rimmed glasses and a knit sweater. She's a killer.) said we should write more words.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. The Agreement</h2>
    <p>By bringing your bike to Scenic Routes Community Bicycle Center ("us," "we," "the shop," "your friendly neighborhood bike mechanics"), you agree to these terms. By providing your phone number, you consent to receive text messages related to your service. This is not a binding contract with an arbitration clause written by a team of corporate attorneys - it's a handshake in written form.</p>

    <h2>2. Our Services</h2>
    <p>We repair, maintain, and occasionally marvel at bicycles. We also sell bikes, parts, and accessories. We do our best work on every bike that comes through the door, whether it's a $10,000 carbon race machine or a rusty Rockhopper that's been in someone's garage since 1987 (we actually love the Rockhopper more).</p>

    <h2>3. Text Message Program</h2>
    <p>When you provide your phone number at drop-off, you're opting in to receive text messages from us about your repair. Here's what that means:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>What we'll text you:</strong> Work order updates, your bike is ready, we have a question, we're waiting on a part, your repair is complete</li>
        <li><strong>What we won't text you:</strong> Marketing, promotions, memes (no matter how good the bike meme is), unsolicited opinions about your tire pressure</li>
        <li><strong>How often:</strong> Only when there's something to say about your repair.</li>
        <li><strong>Cost:</strong> We don't charge for texts. Your carrier might have standard messaging rates. Take that up with them, not us.</li>
        <li><strong>Opt out:</strong> Reply <strong>STOP</strong> to any message. Done. Immediately. No questions asked, no hoops to jump through, no passive-aggressive "we're sorry to see you go" messages.</li>
        <li><strong>Help:</strong> Reply <strong>HELP</strong> and we'll text you back with our contact info.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Estimates &amp; Pricing</h2>
    <p>We provide estimates before starting work. If we discover something unexpected mid-repair (and bikes are full of surprises), we'll contact you before proceeding. We don't believe in surprise bills. Surprises are for birthday parties and pregnancies.</p>

    <h2>5. Abandoned Bikes</h2>
    <p>If you leave your bike with us and don't respond to our attempts to contact you for 90 days, we'll consider it abandoned. We'll make reasonable efforts to reach you first, because we're not monsters. But we're also not a storage facility. Abandoned bikes may be donated to community programs, because at least then someone's riding them.</p>

    <h2>6. Liability</h2>
    <p>We stand behind our work. If something we repaired fails due to our workmanship, bring it back and we'll make it right. That said, we can't be responsible for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Pre-existing conditions we told you about</li>
        <li>Normal wear and tear (entropy comes for us all)</li>
        <li>Modifications you make after pickup</li>
        <li>Acts of nature, theft, or that one pothole on Market Street (or any other one).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Your Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>Pretty simple stuff:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Pick up your bike in a reasonable timeframe</li>
        <li>Pay for the work we do</li>
        <li>Be honest about what happened to the bike (we won't judge. We've seen it all)</li>
        <li>Be kind to our staff. They're doing their best and they genuinely care about your bike.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Privacy</h2>
    <p>We take your privacy seriously. See our <a href="/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a> for the full rundown. The gist: we collect the minimum, we don't sell anything, and we treat your data like we'd want ours treated.</p>

    <h2>9. Disputes</h2>
    <p>If you have a problem with our service, please just talk to us. Come into the shop. Call us. We're reasonable people who fix bikes for a living. We're not looking for conflict. We believe most problems can be solved with a conversation, a cup of coffee, and a willingness to listen. No mandatory arbitration, no class action waivers, no binding legal theater. Just humans working it out. We believe in REPAIR.</p>

    <h2>10. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these terms from time to time. When we do, we'll update the date at the top. We won't make material changes without making it obvious. We're not going to sneak in a clause that gives us your firstborn child or anything.</p>

    <h2>11. The Part Where We Get Philosophical</h2>
    <div class="legal-highlight">
        <p>We believe that a bicycle is one of the most efficient, democratic, and joyful machines ever invented. We believe that everyone deserves access to reliable transportation. We believe that fixing things is better than throwing them away. We believe that a community bike shop is a public good, and that these terms and conditions exist not to protect us from you, but to make sure we're all on the same page so we can get back to the important work: keeping you rolling.</p>
