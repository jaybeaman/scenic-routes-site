    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="tagline">Where your data gets better treatment than an old Altus derailleur.</p>

    <div class="legal-card">
        <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> February 2026</p>
        <p><strong>The short version:</strong> We collect the bare minimum to fix your bike and text you when it's done. We don't sell your data because (a) that's fucked up, (b) we're a bike shop not a data broker, and (c) seriously, that's fucked up.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>We're Scenic Routes Community Bicycle Center, a small bike shop that believes bicycles can save the world, or at least make your commute less miserable. We operate a work order management system ("Trailhead") to keep track of repairs, and sometimes we text you about them.</p>

    <h2>What We Collect</h2>
    <p>Only what we need. Nothing more. We're not interested in building a profile on you. We already know the most important thing: you ride a bike.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Your name</strong> — so we can tell you apart from the other person who dropped off a blue Surly</li>
        <li><strong>Your phone number</strong> — so we can text you when your bike is ready instead of shouting your name out the front door</li>
        <li><strong>Your email</strong> — if you give it to us, for receipts and such</li>
        <li><strong>Your bike info</strong> — make, model, serial number, what's busted</li>
        <li><strong>Work order history</strong> — what we fixed, when, and for how much</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What We Don't Collect</h2>
    <div class="legal-highlight">
        <p>We don't use tracking cookies. We don't use analytics that follow you around the internet. We don't collect your browsing history, your location, your political opinions, your astrological sign, or your feelings about disc brakes vs. rim brakes.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Text Messages (SMS)</h2>
    <p>If you give us your phone number when you drop off a bike, we may send you text messages about your repair. These include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your bike is ready for pickup</li>
        <li>We have a question about your repair</li>
        <li>We're waiting on a part</li>
        <li>Your repair is done and the total is ready</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>To stop receiving texts:</strong> Reply <strong>STOP</strong> at any time. No "are you sure?"s. We won't even miss you.</p>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To fix your bike and tell you about it</li>
        <li>To process your payment</li>
        <li>To look up your repair history if you come back (and we hope you do)</li>
        <li>That's the whole list. There is no fourth thing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Who We Share It With</h2>
    <p><strong>Nobody.</strong> Well, almost nobody:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Twilio</strong> — they transmit our text messages. They're the postal service of SMS. They don't read your messages or care about your bottom bracket.</li>
        <li><strong>Payment processors</strong> — when you pay us, the card network does its thing. We don't store your card number because that sounds like a terrible responsibility.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We will never sell, rent, lease, sublease, timeshare, or otherwise make your information available to third parties for their own purposes. The means of data production belong to the people who generated it - that's you.</p>

    <h2>How We Protect Your Data</h2>
    <p>Your data is stored in an encrypted database on our own server. Not on some big tech company's cloud (well, there's a little bit of cloud, but the important stuff lives with us). We use HTTPS everywhere, and our passwords are stronger than the legs of those Ornot guys.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>See your data</strong> — just ask, we'll show you everything we have</li>
        <li><strong>Fix your data</strong> — if we spelled your name wrong, tell us</li>
        <li><strong>Delete your data</strong> — say the word and it's gone. Poof. Like it never happened.</li>
        <li><strong>Opt out of texts</strong> — reply STOP or just tell us in the shop</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You don't need a lawyer for any of this. Just talk to us like a human being. We're right here in the shop.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>We don't knowingly collect information from anyone under 13. If your kid drops off a bike, we talk to you, the parent. We're old-fashioned like that.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>If we change this policy, we'll update this page. We won't bury changes in fine print or make you agree to new terms by continuing to breathe near our shop. We'll just... tell you. Like neighbors.</p>
