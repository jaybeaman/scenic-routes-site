Once a month, expect to see our little blue logo pop into your mailbox and interrupt the usual flood of advertisements, shipping notifications, and bills to bring you stories of bike joy, shop updates, and pictures of things we found beautiful since the last newsletter.\n\nAs the summer starts to wind down and the sun starts to come out in our little city, I find myself feeling more grateful for our storefront on Balboa than ever before. The quiet solitude of a weekday morning and the busy hubbub of a weekend afternoon are a balm to my weary soul. As many of you know, both Jay and I have been off our bike in the last several months because of injuries. Watching you all roll in and out of the shop has been a constant and necesary reminder of the power that being on two wheels gives you. I'\''m happy to report that we are both cruising again, and ramping up to start offering group rides to keep the vibes stoked through the cold, wet winter.\n\nIn other shop news, our monthly fix-a-flat classes have been a major success, and each one of you that attends gives me hope that in five years the only flats we will be fixing at the shop will be our own! Basic mechanic classes are rolling out, and we are eagerly awaiting your suggestions and input. Expect drivetrain classes, tubeless tire lessons, route planning sessions, bike-packing 101, and anything else your hearts can dream up. Feel free to send us a message in whichever way you prefer, though we may feel especially inclined to make your suggestion happen if you walk on over to the shop to tell us about it!\n\nIn addition to dreaming up new merchandise, new events, and new spaces for our community, we'\''ve been dreaming up new bikes for ourselves:\n\nMy newest ride is a TREK 930 that I found at a Goodwill while looking for picture frames. My hunt for artwork was unsuccessful, but I was more than happy to leave with a different kind of frame. After stripping it to its bones, it got sent off to our powder coater to be covered in a warm chocolate brown fit for the trails of GGP and the Headlands. After sliding the first set of wheels I'\''ve successfully built up onto the frame, I knew she was going to be a show stopper.\n\n![Ayla'\''s Trek 930](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/618d615066c6445d2a0e947f/25d6a6ea-ffff-48ec-823b-6c299aee351e/Tezza-4384.jpg?content-type=image%2Fjpeg&format=750w)\n\nThere is nothing like that first ride on a new bike, when things aren'\''t quite dialed in yet but you can feel the infinite potential of adventure beneath your feet. I was planning on writing up the details of the build here (what cranks, which bars, brakes, racks, etc.) but truth be told, I don'\''t really care. This bike is here for the vibes and only the good ones at that, and the details that really matter to me are the baby blue zip-ties and the basket bag that I'\''m borrowing from Jay.\n\nSpeaking of Jay, if you DO care about the bike details, feel free to swing by and ask Jay about the '\''fast guy bike'\'' he'\''s been itching to build. If you'\''ve ever seen one of Jay'\''s bikes parked out front, you know that utility is at the forefront of his mind while building up frames - big tire clearance, big baskets, and swept back bars for optimal comfort. The bike that is clouding his every daydream these days is what we are calling '\''an ultimate joy machine,'\'' that will hopefully come in at under 25 pounds with a Brooks saddle and dynamo lights on it. The only thing standing in his way is sourcing the perfect Goldilocks steel frame for our shop princess.\n\nIt'\''s been a fun reminder that there is always another dream bike, and working in a shop makes it all too easy to be inspired when your beautiful bikes roll into our stands.\n\n---\n\n![Our tree is doin'\'' fine](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/618d615066c6445d2a0e947f/21c68e18-4e32-4f1a-b56c-b005c532e1b6/tempImagewQ1VPJ.jpg?content-type=image%2Fjpeg&format=750w)\n\n*our tree is doin'\'' fine*\n\nIn the meantime, we will keep riding the bikes we'\''ve got, and riding them hard!\n\n---\n\nReady for some fun goodies we'\''ve got cookin for you? For the first time ever, we are branching out into the world of preorders. Pick your color, your size, and patiently wait for your new favorite sweatshirt to arrive. We'\''ll be rolling out embroidered sweatshirts to match our beloved hats. Don'\''t tell him I told you, but Jay'\''s favorite compliment is being called \"the slow is forever guy.\"\n\n---\n\n## New!

Next, sweatshirts, and then, the world!!\n\n---\n\nThanks for reading! I will probably get better at this (one can hope), but as a reward for making it to here, enjoy my first recurring segment called:\n\n**\"THINGS MEN SAID TO ME ON MY BIKE THIS WEEK\"**\n\n(rated from least worst to worst)\n\n5. \"WHOA! Sick Bike!\" 10/10, no notes, love the enthusiasm.\n\n4. (While struggling up hawk hill, fighting to speak and breathe at the same time) \"We got this, we can do this\" 8/10, I love the sportsmanship, but bold of you to assume I was worried about making it up the hill\n\n3. (I'\''m loading up my basket..) \"Wow, isn'\''t that an interesting idea, but you'\''re definitely not going to put your bag in there are you... WOW, she did it\" 5/10, Why are you ogling me and talking about me like can'\''t hear?? But I will always be willing to spread the basket life manifesto.\n\n2. (Leaning out of his car window) \"Hey Sweetheart!...\" Followed by a whistle and some words my memory has decided to bury, 1/10, the only person who can call me sweetheart is my GRANDMA!!\n\n1. \"Wow, you'\''re going to have some really nice legs riding a bike like that around\" 0/10, absolutely vile comment. In what world are we talking about a woman'\''s legs at 10am while waiting for a bagel??\n\n---\n\nOkay team, Thanks for reading! Feel free to send us your photos, your stories of bike joy, you questions, concerns, and dreams, and you might just seem them here next time :)\n\n- Ayla\n\np.s. if you find any typos in this, feel free to call your mom and cry about it, since she'\''s the only one that cares."
